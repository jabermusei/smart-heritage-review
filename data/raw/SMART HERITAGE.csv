Smart Heritage, the novel convergence of smart city and heritage disciplines, is one interdisciplinary discourse that local governments utilise to address these demands. To successfully deliver Smart Heritage, local governments must understand how the interdisciplinary relationships, influence, and aspirations function within their organisation. However, due to the novelty of Smart Heritage, no academic research exists on these matters, particularly within local government contexts. Therefore, this article reports how relationships, influence, and strategic aspirations between the smart city and heritage discipline intersect as Smart Heritage. It draws on interviews with smart city and heritage advisors from three local governments in Australia. It finds a case-by-case working relationship between the disciplines, which indicates an emergent-yet-tenuous Smart Heritage discourse. Moreover, the interdisciplinary relationships influence broader considerations from the advisors than their single discipline. These considerations produce innovative aspirations for local governments on heritage and smart city matters. This finding establishes the first foundational understanding of Smart Heritage within local government.","2020","2025-07-05 00:14:49","2025-07-17 18:30:13","","","","","","","Heritage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\GUZ9TDKQ\David Batchelor e Marc Aurel Schnabel - 2020 - Interdisciplinary Relationships, Influence, and Aspirations for Smart Heritage in Local Government.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chowdhary; Swasti Vardhan Mishra; Anwesha Aditi","Varanasi—The Making of a Smart Heritage City","Environment and Urbanization Asia","","0975-4253","10.1177/09754253241230588","","One of the oldest cities in the world, Varanasi is home to more than one religion. It is an acclaimed centre of spirituality for Hindus and Buddhists while being equally sacred for Jains and Sikhs. The city is located along the river Ganga, which many believe is a celestial incarnation to grant salvation. Varanasi is a million-plus-population city; an increasingly important provincial metropolitan centre enshrined with the values of commerce, religion, ritual and tradition; and caught between the confluence and contestations of traditions and modernity. Since 2016, Varanasi has been incorporated under India’s Smart Cities Mission (SCM) to develop the city into a smart city with a strong focus on heritage and tourism. The present article is an attempt to trace the journey of the city that has developed as a palimpsest over centuries; it deliberates the contemporary urban landscape and maps out recent urban and infrastructure developments of the city and its concerns. This article also argues that Varanasi has focused on locally specific everyday urbanisms with heritage and culture and pivoted to making itself a Smart Heritage City.","2024","2025-07-05 00:14:49","2025-07-17 18:31:56","","","","","","","Environment and Urbanization Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\2KSGJYIK\Diganta Das et al. - 2024 - Varanasi—The Making of a Smart Heritage City.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system enlists the software ‘Houdini’ and a digitally archived dataset of 19th Century timber Gothic churches. The cases presented here focus primarily on timber churches built in Wellington, New Zealand. Through a process of analysis and deconstruction of these historic churches into their characteristic architectural components, spatial organisation and geometric relationships, the system assembles them into novel designs based on high-level design parameters. This paper details this computational system, its development, its operation and its outputs. The role of the system that has been developed is two-fold. One is designing in an architectural heritage context, and one is as an aid to historical architectural investigations, or what can be called digital forensics. The particular outputs are automatically generated hybrid churches that capture the historical design values and complexities of Gothic inspired churches in New Zealand. However, the broader applications are as an investigative tool for historians, and as an objective generative tool for those involved in heritage reconstruction.","2021","2025-07-05 00:14:49","2025-07-17 18:26:46","","","","","","","Heritage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\XDBA4S32\Sam McLennan e André G.P.

Heritage settlements acted as a resilient effort in adapting urban developments. Based on the archipelago’s potential wealth in ethnic diversities and cultural communities, the heterogeneity of urban society has always existed. Ethnic settlements (such as Chinese) are often found in developing countries. The unique characteristics of Chinese ethnic settlements set them apart from other ethnic settlements in the same city (such as Arab, Javanese, and others) in terms of their physical environment and community activities. The values of local wisdom in Chinese ethnic settlements in Chinatown Area of Malang were explored and compared to Kembang Jepun area of Surabaya, using typology as an approach in data analysis and processing. Urban design elements such as land use, style, building functions, accessibility, circulation, public space, green space, signage and conservation areas were discussed in this study context of urban heritage. The aim of the study was to be the future guidelines to the government in directing special ethnic settlements’ arrangement (especially Chinese) along with the characters, as well as providing theoretical input for academics to strengthen the local characters with relatively different ethnic settlements in various cities of archipelago. This study showed that Chinese architecture tolerate, adapt and maintain physical aspects through buildings and the living culture.","2023","2025-07-05 00:14:50","2025-07-06 19:44:56","","","","","","","Iop Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart Heritage is the convergence between the smart city and heritage disciplines that intertwines the autonomous and automatic capabilities and innovation of smart technologies with the contextual and subjective interpretation of the past. It is an emergent and distinct discourse in the academic literature that positions technology as the leadcurator of historical narratives. It is comparable with similar smart discourses, such as Smart Mobility and Smart Infrastructure, and contrasts with the human-led and archival focused Digital Heritage discourse. Through Smart Heritage, urban designers and planners are not physically, intellectually, and locationally limited in retelling and deploying culturally and socially powerful historical narratives. Instead, experts can draw online and personal data to produce powerful and novel experiences in cities. This article introduces Smart Heritage as a tool for urban designers and planners.

Moreover, digital technologies favor “phygital” applications where the digital dimension support the traditional ones. In this way, AR allows the superimposition of multimedia information to heritage, respecting the historical matter of the artefacts, and supporting a “smart heritage” application. In particular, mobile AR, with real-time and ubiquitous visualizations, offers the opportunity to show past urban and architectural configurations to investigate and describe the transformations that have led to the current configuration, and consequently highlighting the present historical and architectural values of the buildings.

Some of these cultural assets and events tend to be monotonous, and not so attractive for various categories of tourists, which negatively affects investment opportunities, tourism development, and social and economic resources. Furthermore, previous works have criticized the lack of evidence to support that the structure contains critical attributes and measurement items linked to the competitiveness of smart heritage destinations. As a result, this study aims to design and develop a composite index for evaluating these destinations and their buildings, which includes nine dimensions (attributes) and a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of intelligent performance and competitiveness, reflecting the combination and noticing the distinct perspective between them. A mixed-methods approach was used between qualitative and quantitative methods to perform content validation on the proposed index. Furthermore, a pilot study was implemented for tourism heritage destinations to improve the quality and efficiency of the proposed index. Then, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to analyze the data to develop the proposed index and measure its validity and reliability. Finally, the proposed composite index was finalized with 139 KPIs and applied to a case study (Salah El-Din Citadel). After that, we validated its utility in providing a quantitative evaluation of this heritage destination, identifying critical intervention priorities, and determining dimensions that need to be restructured. Additionally, it highlighted recommendations for future improvements to strengthen these heritage destinations to become smart heritage destinations capable of competition in the tourism sector.","2021","2025-07-05 00:14:50","2025-07-05 01:21:42","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM TECH SMART","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Providing public access to heritage promotes a social interest in its conservation but, at the same time, it poses a risk to the conservation of resources. The biggest challenge in managing public use of heritage is to establish a sustainable relationship between heritage and tourism. The multidisciplinary teams involved in visitor flow management generate and exchange information about the heritage property without an integrative vision. The lack of a reliable, unified and up-to-date source of information generally hinders decision-making, causes errors and leads to inappropriate practices in heritage visitor flow management, thereby putting the conservation of resources at risk because of the impacts derived from visitation while the quality experience is also affected. Building Information Modelling (BIM) provides a collaborative framework where multidisciplinary teams share geometric and documentary information about the building in a coordinated way. This tool applied to heritage (HBIM) is demonstrating how it is able to improve efficiency in documenting, intervening and managing heritage. Beyond these aforementioned skills, the objective of this study is to identify the potential of HBIM to improve the efficiency of the visitor flow management. The methodology includes a literature review, qualitative data collection and technical documentation analysis. The results indicate that the use of HBIM can optimise the planning and management of visitor flows, by virtually foreseeing the possible risks derived from visits. It can also calculate recreational carrying capacity and analyse alternatives to itineraries that minimise the deterioration of the most fragile spaces.","2020","2025-07-05 00:14:51","2025-07-17 18:30:26","","","","","","","The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\BQSAJ4T5\Elena Salvador-García et al. - 2020 - Potential of Hbim to Improve the Efficiency of Visitor Flow Management in Heritage Sites.

It is more complicated than the Dougong and represents a high level of artistic and structural achievement. Archaeological research on Xiegong is urgent due to the fast rate of erosion rate and the official record of only Dougong without Xiegong. With 3D survey technology, researchers can use 3D digital replicas to record and survey heritage buildings. However, the methodology of applying digital reproductions to facilitate archaeological research is unclear. A comprehensive approach to merging the digital twin into the chronology of forms was proposed based on a literature review of archaeological theory. This multi-methodological approach, including laser scanning, oblique photogrammetry, and BIM, was adopted to develop Xiegong’s architectural archaeology dating research. Using Xuanluo Hall, Sichuan, China, as an example, the site study verified the approach to ensure consistency between 2D and 3D expressions with geometry and semantics. The results indicate that, on the one hand, the digital twin process can help archaeologists recognize historical information. On the other hand, the results of their discrimination can be effectively recorded and easily queried, avoiding the shortcomings of traditional methods of information loss and dispersion.","2022","2025-07-05 00:14:51","2025-07-06 19:58:48","","","","","","","Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach to the integrated management of information derived through Heritage-BIM (H-BIM) has been applied to Via del Duomo, one of the main roads in the old town of Naples, Italy. During preliminary inspections of the construction site it was possible to acquire geometric features and pavement/subgrade information, as well as to conduct a photographic survey, with 1,618 photographs collected. Subsequently, the acquired data were processed, using different BIM-based tools, to obtain the 3D mesh; objects were then converted from pure graphic solids into parametric entities by proposing a specific algorithm. Then a library, with the inclusion of all the possible stone paving package alternatives, including all the structural and stress-deforming characteristics such as Young Modulus (E), Poisson coefficient (n), and Safety factor (SF), was created. In this way, it is possible to associate to the generic element the optimal pavement package solution, depending on different construction contexts. As preliminary result, a dynamic model that updates its information package and modifies the output of the analysis every time the data worksheet is integrated with new collected results is proposed for further pavement management operations evaluation.","2021","2025-07-05 00:14:51","2025-07-05 19:29:56","","","","","","","Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mixed Reality (MxR) is a promising technology for achieving these goals. By leveraging MxR, cultural heritage sites can provide tourists with engaging and educational experiences, allowing them to delve into the rich history and cultural significance of these sites. However, the quality of content in MxR applications can significantly impact the overall experience and educational value. This research proposes best practices for MxR development in smart heritage tourism, ensuring the delivery of high-quality, culturally authentic, and educational experiences to visitors. A qualitative approach has been adopted to achieve this aim, utilizing the Speak Aloud method to collect data from participants who interacted with the MxR prototype. The study focuses on a case study of the Jugra heritage urban landscape, using it as a basis for developing an MxR prototype. The research encompasses two stages: the first is the design for prototype development, and the second is to test the application for user feedback. Through discussions on prototype design development and user experience testing, the research proposes a storyboard framework as a guideline for designing the MxR environment. This framework serves as a comprehensive blueprint, ensuring that each phase, from data analysis to the final Mixed Reality application, is meticulously designed and executed. Respondents tested the prototype to gather feedback on the prototype's outcomes, enabling refinement of the blueprint for subsequent levels of testing with heritage visitors. The results of this study contribute to the field of MxR development in smart heritage tourism. The research enables developers to create high-quality, culturally authentic, educational MxR experiences by offering guidelines and best practices.

Therefore, a new approach is presented that considers deployment scenarios by linking heritage science to tourism. Such an approach is necessary because neither technology nor society views can be treated separately to obtain deployable solutions of a wider social, and even national importance. Clearly, while the traditional approaches to cultural heritage preservation will remain a gold standard, they will be increasingly complemented by digital preservation techniques. Thus, based on practical implementations and lessons learnt in other areas, this multidisciplinary framework paper analyses existing disruptive information technologies deployments. In line with the findings it presents a novel technological architecture tailored to the needs of cultural heritage preservation that deploys an open blockchain architecture. The architecture preserves the advantages of traditional blockchains, which made this technology so important, while enabling energy efficient implementations that can be deployed in mobile applications. By additionally using the contribution-ware principle it links it to tourism, where the identification of users focused incentives and business models play a central role. It is obvious that tourism is a good candidate in such preservation efforts due to the organic links between it and cultural heritage and can support further developments in the heritage preservation domain.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:30","2025-07-17 18:29:00","","","","","","","Heritage Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\RV8F3DU7\Denis Trček - 2022 - Cultural Heritage Preservation by Using Blockchain Technologies.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2017 we published a seminal research study in the International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing &amp;amp; Spatial Information Sciences about how smart city tools, solutions and applications underpinned historical and cultural heritage of cities at that time (Angelidou et al. 2017). We now return to investigate the progress that has been made during the past three years, and specifically whether the weak substantiation of cultural heritage in smart city strategies that we observed in 2017 has been improved. The newest literature suggests that smart cities should capitalize on local strengths and give prominence to local culture and traditions and provides a handful of solutions to this end. However, a more thorough examination of what has been actually implemented reveals a (still) rather immature approach. The smart city cases that were selected for the purposes of this research include Tarragona (Spain), Budapest (Hungary) and Karlsruhe (Germany). For each one we collected information regarding the overarching structure of the initiative, the positioning of cultural heritage and the inclusion of heritage-related smart city applications. We then performed a comparative analysis based on a simplified version of the Digital Strategy Canvas. Our findings suggest that a rich cultural heritage and a broader strategic focus on touristic branding and promotion are key ingredients of smart city development in this domain; this is a commonality of all the investigated cities. Moreover, three different strategy architectures emerge, representing the different interplays among the smart city, cultural heritage and sustainable urban development. We conclude that a new generation of smart city initiatives is emerging, in which cultural heritage is of increasing importance. This generation tends to associate cultural heritage with social and cultural values, liveability and sustainable urban development.","2020","2025-07-05 00:14:51","2025-07-17 18:28:56","","","","","","","Isprs Annals of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\DKUR572I\Margarita Angelidou e Efstratios Stylianidis - 2020 - Cultural Heritage in Smart City Environments The Update.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to these restrictions, which were imposed due to health policy considerations, cultural heritage assets are now under more pressure to continue operating and preserving their legacy. The approach for the protection and preservation of cultural heritage assets must be upgraded digitally. By conducting a thorough literature analysis, this research seeks to investigate how cultural heritage assets underwent digital change during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 334 results were returned for the search term. Unfortunately, only a total of 19 papers that were evaluated to be pertinent to the study issue. The analysis of these 19 papers showed that cultural heritage must be transformed digitally not just for conservation and preservation but also for improving visitor experiences, increasing understanding of the past, and educating, promoting, and managing heritage sites. The use of digital technology is mostly done to boost consumer interaction, enhance business performance, and support management needs. Advanced technologies including augmented and virtual reality, 3D reconstruction, digital twins, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are used to assist these purposes. Heritage managers may now continue their operations by providing visitors with virtual tours and displays. Also, certain institutes of higher learning are utilising this occasion to do study on the digitisation of historical assets. The analysis also suggests that the present stage of research on the digital transformation of cultural heritage assets is digitalisation. This is where technology adoption is focused on automating current business operations and procedures. Therefore, there are more opportunities for exploring the digital transformation of cultural heritage assets in order to reach a greater degree of digital transformation.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:30","2025-07-17 18:30:55","","","","","","","International Journal of Real Estate Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\8RINXKVT\Nor Fatimah Abd Hamid - 2023 - Systematic Literature Review of the Digital Transformation of Cultural Heritage Assets During the CO.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on big data technology, cloud computing technology, and Internet of Things technology, smart buildings provide smart and convenient devices and services for smart device users. The Internet of Things technology is entering our lives at an unimaginable speed. It has been applied in many fields. Smart home, smart transportation, smart medical, smart agriculture, and smart grid are widely used in the Internet of Things technology. The application of Internet of Things technology to the construction of folk sports characteristic towns is of great significance. The construction of folk sports characteristic towns and the protection of intangible cultural heritage have the same purpose and interoperability of elements as the development of traditional cities. From the perspective of protecting folk culture and intangible cultural heritage, it is effective to promote the development of small towns with folk custom characteristics. Based on the research on the construction of folk-custom sports towns, this paper proposes a series of data model analysis and analyzes the proportion of sports preferences in the survey of volunteers in the folk-custom sports towns. The final result of the research shows that the ball games sports personnel accounted for the largest proportion, with 156 people accounting for 48.15%. This shows that about half of the people like ball sports, which proves that ball sports should be the mainstay of folk sports towns, and other sports should be supplemented by other sports.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:30","2025-07-05 19:26:30","","","","","","","Applied Bionics and Biomechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RETRATADO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper bridges these gaps by proposing a methodology and a set of requirements for Building Information Modeling (BIM) models aligned with European directives for sustainability and productivity in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector. Leveraging 3D scanning and intelligent models, we establish information needs specific to conservation, encompassing material properties, historical data, and decay analysis. Interoperability, compatibility with advanced analytical tools, and open-source formats are emphasized for seamless data integration and accessibility. We further introduce two use cases for BIM-enabled heritage conservation, illustrating the application of our proposed methodology in real-world scenarios. These cases exemplify how BIM models cater to the specific needs of cultural heritage sites, from their initial condition assessment to ongoing preservation efforts. Through these examples, we demonstrate the adaptability of BIM technology in capturing and managing the complex information associated with heritage conservation, including structural details, material characteristics, and historical significance.

The technical provisions for protecting built cultural heritage originate from the interdisciplinary disciplines of architecture and engineering, which mutually operate despite encountering specific challenges. Therefore, the lack of adaptable applications capable of integrating the management of complex data originating from various sources has prompted the development of an Internet-of- Things-based application that enables ""on-the-fly"" data acquisition and information processing from distant locations, records the timeline on a remote desktop, and sends email and brief early warning text messages of alarm when a programmed threshold is exceeded. Furthermore, a dedicated platform is designed to administer and grant users access to a database containing data gathered through the analysis of diagnostic non-destructive methods (i.e., archival documentation, image processing for infrared thermography, acoustic and ultrasonic tomography, and so forth). The system architecture is distinguished by a distributed intelligence consisting of multiple nodes, which enables the remote processing of locally acquired information. The arrangement was strategically planned to optimize the utilization of the wireless digital bus connecting sensors and data storage units. This enables the examination of the case study to be conducted remotely, with all collected data accessible in a suitable semantic web environment.

Mount Lushan in China is such a site which in the past has had shortcomings in heritage protection and heritage tourism marketing. The present research addresses this issue by using digital technologies such as oblique aerial photography, 3D laser scanning technology, and 360 degrees panorama technology to digitize the Mount Lushan cultural landscape heritage site, integrating all elements to create a virtual tourism subsystem. It provides users with a virtual experience of cultural landscape heritage tourism and promotes cultural landscape tourism marketing. In addition, tourist flow and environmental subsystems were built through the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and analytical models. The tourist flow subsystem can help managers to regulate tourist flow according to the tourist carrying capacity threshold. Managers can also conduct environmental health assessment and management through the ""pressure-state-response"" model provided by the environmental subsystem. Finally, a comprehensive platform was developed based on the system concept, which integrated the three subsystems and their functions, and developed different versions to provide a visual platform for tourists and managers. This study provides a new model for the joint development of cultural heritage protection and tourism activities.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-17 18:30:16","","","","","","","Heritage Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\NZPHK8W8\Zhenrao Cai et al. - 2021 - Joint Development of Cultural Heritage Protection and Tourism The Case of Mount Lushan Cultural Lan.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, preservation processes that do not include any physical interaction with an object or collection can be regarded as preventive conservation. Preventive conservation measures and activities include among others the monitoring and management of environmental factors, in order to reduce potential risks of collections condition. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help towards this goal by automating the collection of data through sensors deployed in the cultural space and providing available services based on the IoT ecosystem. IoT technologies can facilitate the preventive conservation of tangible CH by exploiting streaming data produced by networks of sensors that keep track of changes in environmental parameters of a particular museum, in order to monitor the condition of its collections. Moreover, Semantic Web (SW) technologies could increase the efficiency of sensed data management by introducing reasoning mechanisms that will result in useful inferences regarding the combination of long-term or short-term records of sensed data and material decay. This work summarizes current state-of-the-art frameworks and monitoring systems that collect data from sensors in CH environments and the use of semantic web technologies for the efficient management of conservation and sensor data. Based on this study, it proposes an IoT infrastructure with semantic tools, which aims to enhance preventive conservation science.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-17 18:30:38","","","","","","","International Conference on Cultural Informatics Communication &Amp; Media Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\3DFBP2PT\Konstantinos Michalakis et al. - 2020 - Semantic Representation and Internet of Things in Cultural Heritage Preventive Conservation.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Settlements represent areas where people reside over the long term, including villages, towns, etc., and their spatial distribution reflects the interplay between human activities and the natural environment, as well as historical heritage. The relationship among population distribution, land use, cultural heritage preservation areas, and resident lifestyles can be understood by analyzing the spatial distribution of settlements. This is crucial for formulating effective urban planning and cultural heritage protection strategies. Initially, factor analysis is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the original multidimensional data. Subsequently, the hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to categorize and cluster settlements based on these factors, then combines them into clusters, thereby revealing the spatial distribution patterns among different settlements. Next, this study constructs a settlement spatial distribution model based on factor analysis combined with the hierarchical clustering algorithm. Additionally, through accessibility analysis, this study examines the situation of residents accessing cultural heritage sites at different times during weekdays and weekends. The results indicate that with a classification number of 4, the Goodness of Variance Fit (GVF) for different hierarchical features exceeds 0.7, and the average silhouette coefficient reaches 0.58 at this classification number. Furthermore, the accessibility analysis also illustrates residents’ visiting patterns to cultural heritage sites on weekends and weekdays, providing valuable insights for urban planning and cultural heritage preservation. Therefore, this study concludes that categorizing settlements into four classes in this area is reasonable and emphasizes the importance of cultural heritage site preservation and urban planning. This method demonstrates a high level of accuracy and interpretability in spatial analysis.","2025","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-17 18:30:50","","","","","","","Plos One","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\76A6N9IH\Xiaojie Feng - 2025 - Spatial Distribution Characteristics and Accessibility Analysis in the Weibei Imperial Mausoleum Pro.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has put it at the forefront of many significant debates around its applicability and implications. In the case of its application to cultural heritage, although there is much trailblazing to do, the body of work has been growing and the field is gaining its maturity. As such, this paper aims to take stock of the directions the field has been moving towards—to provide orientation for future work and projects that are yet to be developed. To do this, the paper aims to map out the publications in the field of gamified cultural heritage, by conducting a broader and systematic literature review. The study has found that, with regards to who the main actors with publications in the field are, a prominence of European institutions and networks, namely from Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom, can be observed. Regarding what heritage is being gamified and for what purpose, the study found a prominence of focus on historical, architectural and archeological heritage values and a very significant focus on gamification being used for motivation/engagement and for creativity enhancement. When looking at the gamification design dimensions that are given prevalence, intrinsic motivation seems to be prioritized, and, with regards to the observed target publics, tourists and visitors and seem to prevail in gamified heritage projects, with children as a specific group coming in second. Regarding technologies and tools being used, Mobile Applications, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are particularly prevalent.

In this sense, the European Horizon 2020 project CollectionCare aims to provide an affordable preventive conservation service for individual objects focused to small museums with limited budgets. Although the use of data loggers has been a must in the past, new deployments tend to use wired and wireless sensors that provide real-time information and the ability to instantly analyse the data, allowing immediate action to be taken in the event of a threat towards a cultural object. For already constructed buildings, wireless systems have the advantage that, a priori, deployments are simpler, faster and cheaper, but have to deal with complex heritage environments with long distances to be covered and very thick walls to cross. In many cases, commercial systems of this type are not economically viable for small museums with limited budgets. Moreover, conservators who try to approach such solutions are often overwhelmed by unclear technical specifications that do not allow them to determine whether the solution fits their environment or not, giving rise to great frustration. Among others, the CollectionCare includes the design of a specific low-cost wireless sensor, being the aim of this article to present to both technical and non-technical readers, the design choices made regarding the housing, attachment method, power source, wireless transmission technique and selection of the environmental sensors following European standards. Also, the effective implementation of the device in three stages to prove the concep until to get a near-production version is presented. The developed device has been deployed in museums in Belgium, Italy, Greece, Latvia, Denmark and Spain, and the validation results are presented, showing that it is feasible to have a cost-effective proposal that it is easy to install and configure and can operate for 10 years without the need for maintenance or battery replacement except if it is needed to comply with annual recalibration if standards such as ISO 11799:2015 are required.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-06 19:53:45","","","","","","","Heritage Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to address this deficiency through a thorough bibliometric analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) literature from 1995 to 2024, integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches to elucidate the macro-level evolution of the field. Our analysis reveals that the integration of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has significantly enhanced digital documentation, artifact identification, and overall cultural heritage management. Looking forward, it is imperative that research endeavors expand the application of these techniques into multidisciplinary domains, including ecological monitoring and social policy. Additionally, this paper examines non-invasive identification methods for material classification and damage detection, highlighting the role of advanced modeling in optimizing the management of heritage sites. The emergence of keywords such as ‘ecosystem services’, ‘models’, and ‘energy’ in the recent literature underscores a shift toward sustainable practices in cultural heritage conservation. This trend reflects a growing recognition of the interconnectedness between heritage preservation and environmental sciences.

This paper improves the accuracy of the extraction, location, and analysis of artifacts using hyperspectral methods. To improve the accuracy of cultural relic mining, positioning, and analysis, the segmentation algorithm of Sanxingdui cultural relics based on the spatial spectrum integrated network is proposed with the support of hyperspectral techniques. Firstly, region stitching algorithm based on the relative position of hyper spectrally collected data is proposed to improve stitching efficiency. Secondly, given the prominence of traditional HRNet (High-Resolution Net) models in high-resolution data processing, the spatial attention mechanism is put forward to obtain spatial dimension information.

Such a comparison offers a metaphorical framework for discussing complex phenomena such as shared consciousness and individuality, illuminating their bearing on perceptions of self and awareness. Further, the paper considers the ethical implications of these concepts, including potential loss of individuality and the challenges inherent to accurate representation of historical figures and cultures. The latter necessitates collaboration with cultural experts, underscoring the intersectionality of technological innovation and cultural sensitivity. Ultimately, this chapter contributes to a deeper understanding of the technical aspects of integrating large language models with immersive technologies and situates these developments within a nuanced cultural and ethical discourse. By offering a comprehensive overview and proposing clear recommendations, the paper lays the groundwork for future research and development in the application of these technologies within the unique context of cultural heritage representation in the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-17 18:29:48","","","","","","","Metaverse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\U529VBL6\James Hutson - 2023 - Individuality and the Collective in AI Agents Explorations of Shared Consciousness and Digital Homu.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology provides a valuable means of continuous feedback on perceived risk of the site. A semantic analysis on Twitter text messages provided input to the risk management team with which they could respond immediately mitigating any apparent risk and reducing the perceived risk. A two-stage approach was adopted to prune a massively large dataset from Twitter. In the first phase, a social network analysis and visualisation tool NodeXL was used to determine the most recurrent words, which was achieved using polarity. This resulted in a suitable subset. In the second phase, the subset was subjected to sentiment and emotion mapping by survey participants. This led to a hybrid approach of using automation for pruning datasets from social media and using a human approach to sentiment and emotion analysis. Whilst suffering from COVID-19, equally, people suffered due to loneliness from isolation dictated by the World Health Organisation. The work revealed that despite such conditions, people’s sentiments demonstrated a positive effect from the online discussions on the Herculaneum site.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-05 19:33:30","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The unprecedented availability of data allows us to not only improve advanced knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of urban dynamics, but also enact data evidence-based transformative processes and actions in the direction of smarter, more sustainable, resilient, and socially equitable cities. In this context, the literature on smart cities has recently expressed the need to more deeply involve urban visions and communities in the process of regeneration. This paper aims to analyze how big data can be useful in understanding the effectiveness of small pilot actions of regeneration and reactivation in valuable cultural heritage (CH) urban environments. Pilot actions were developed in the context of the European Union funded project “ROCK—Regeneration and Optimization of cultural heritage in Creative and Knowledge cities” (GA730280). The paper analyses data collected by the ROCK City People Flow tool, in different use and time conditions, in two central squares of Bologna (Italy), in order to rate event successes, spatial transformation effects, and regeneration tactics responses.

Therefore, this paper puts forward the research on the management and protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage based on spatial information technology under the background of Internet of things and selects sports intangible cultural heritage as an example, combined with GIS technology and virtual reality technology. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the types of Chinese sports intangible cultural heritage are mainly martial arts, lack of water and ice and snow activities. The spatial distribution is uneven, with regional and ethnic differences, and six core density circles are formed in the form of clusters. Ecological environment, declaration system, and project classification are the main influencing factors of the spatial distribution of China’s sports intangible cultural heritage. Therefore, in the management and protection of sports intangible cultural heritage, we should not only consider the impact of its ecological environment, but also give it modern function and inheritance form in combination with the needs of modern society while maintaining its connotation and spirit, so as to promote its protection, development, and inheritance.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:31","2025-07-17 18:30:05","","","","","","","Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\PMHUQ5BL\Jiaxi Sun - 2022 - Intangible Cultural Heritage Management and Protection Based on Spatial Information Technology Under.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is challenging to design a time series storage model that can write massive time-series data in a short time and can query and analyze the persistent time-series data for a long time. This paper constructs the RHTSDB (Redis-HBase Time Series Database) storage model based on Redis and HBase. RHTSDB uses the memory database Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) to cache massive time-series data, providing efficient data storage and query functions. HBase is used in RHTSDB for long-term storage of time-series data to realize their persistence. The paper designs a cold and hot separation mechanism for time-series data, where the infrequently accessed cold data are stored in HBase, and the frequently accessed and latest data are stored in Redis. Experiments verify that RHTSDB has apparent advantages over Apache IoTDB and HBase in data intake and query efficiency.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:32","2025-07-05 01:36:40","","","","","","","Journal of Database Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These books are waiting to be reorganized at the moment. However, a large amount of the books are described by Kuzushiji, a type of handwriting cursive script that is no longer in use today and only readable by a few experts. Therefore, researchers are trying to detect and recognise the characters from these books through modern techniques. Unfortunately, the characteristics of the Kuzushiji, such as Connect‐Separate‐characters and Many‐variation, hinder the modern technique assisted re‐organisation. Connect‐Separate‐characters refer to the case of some characters connecting each other or one character being separated into unconnected parts, which makes character detection hard. Many‐variation is one of the typical characteristics of Kuzushiji, defined as the case that the same character has several variations even if they are written by the same person in the same book at the same time, which increases the difficulty of character recognition. In this sense, this paper aims to construct an early Japanese book reorganisation system by combining image processing and deep learning techniques. The experimentation has been done by testing two early Japanese books. In terms of character detection, the final Recall, Precision and F‐value reaches 79.8%, 80.3%, and 80.0%, respectively. The deep learning based character recognition accuracy of Top3 reaches 69.52%, and the highest recognition rate reaches 82.57%, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposal.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:32","2025-07-05 19:25:35","","","","","","","Caai Transactions on Intelligence Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objective of this study is to develop a framework for integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their capacity for effective photogrammetry with site layout planning optimisation and Building Information Modelling (BIM) for automating site layout planning in large construction projects. The mathematical model proposed is based on a mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which was employed to validate the framework on a realistic case study provided by an industry partner. Allocation constraints were formulated to ensure the placement of the facilities in feasible regions. Using information from the UAV, several parameters could be considered, including proximity to access ways, distances between the facilities, and suitability of locations. Based on the proposed framework, a layout was developed for each stage of the project, adapting the location of temporary facilities according to current progress on-site.

A geographic detector is employed to quantitatively elucidate the factors influencing the CCD. The findings are as follows. (1) The comprehensive RR level increased 86% from 2011 to 2020, whereas the THD level first increased and then decreased. The southwest region outperformed the northwest in RR and THD levels. (2) The CCD between RR and THD displayed various degrees of increase, with a spatial pattern of higher levels in the southwest and lower levels in the northwest. The spatial linkage strength of the CCD first increased and then decreased, with tighter linkages among the southwestern provinces. (3) Public fiscal expenditure, per capita GDP, and science and education spending significantly affected the CCD.

Traditional preservation methods primarily rely on periodic inspections and manual interventions and struggle to address these evolving and dynamic threats. This systematic review analyzes how integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can transform cultural heritage preservation. Using the PRISMA guidelines, 92 articles from SCOPUS were reviewed, highlighting key risk management and environmental monitoring methodologies. The study found that while IoT enables real-time air quality and structural health monitoring, AI enhances data analysis, providing predictive insights. The combination of IoT and AI facilitates proactive risk management, ensuring more resilient conservation strategies. Despite the growing use of these technologies, adoption remains uneven, particularly in regions most impacted by climate change. The study identifies significant research gaps and proposes an innovative framework that leverages Heritage Building Information Modeling (H-BIM) and Digital Twin (DT) for continuous monitoring and predictive maintenance through a multi-step process, beginning with the digitalization of heritage assets using H-BIM, followed by the creation of real-time digital replicas via DT. By integrating advanced technologies, the framework offers a more adaptive and sustainable approach to preserving cultural heritage, addressing both immediate threats and long-term vulnerabilities.

Existing systems are often costly, inflexible and do not use a modern, internet of things (IoT) approach. This paper aims to determine the suitability of currently popular general-purpose IoT devices, standards and technologies to the environmental monitoring needs of archivists, as well as identify any challenges. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes an exploratory study detailing the design, construction and usability testing of a do-it-yourself datalogger and data dashboard system, which seeks to manage previously identified trade-offs in cost, required technical skill and maintainability. Findings The environmental monitoring system presented met archivists’ needs well and was generally noted to be easy-to-use, efficient and an improvement on existing systems. This suggests that an IoT approach can support archivists’ needs in this area. Research limitations/implications Potential limitations of this study include lack of archival staff with sufficient technical training to maintain such a system and the rapid pace of IoT evolution yielding unstable and constantly changing technologies. Practical implications The system design presented in this work provides a blueprint for cultural heritage organizations desiring a fuller-featured, lower cost environmental monitoring system for archival collections.

Research explores the integration of internet of things (IoT) technologies and advanced deep learning (DL) methods to manage and distribute data that include digital representations of artifacts, historical sites, and cultural practices. Data including location, environmental conditions, and user interactions, are collected via IoT devices to enhance the learning experience. Pre-processing techniques, such as median filtering and standardization, are applied to clean and normalize the data, ensuring its quality and consistency. Feature extraction methods, including discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA), are employed to capture the most relevant characteristics of the cultural data. The novel refined nutcracker optimized deep neural network (RNO-DNN) model is designed to intelligently analyze the pre-processed data, enabling personalized learning and immersive cultural experiences. The RNO-DNN enhances the accuracy of content recommendations and optimizes the system’s performance in real-time interactions. It also addresses challenges such as data privacy, computational efficiency, and the technical infrastructure required for RNO-DNN integration. The findings highlight the potential of combining IoT with DL to revolutionize the accessibility, engagement, and preservation of traditional cultural content, making it a critical tool for modern education and cultural heritage management.","2025","2025-07-05 00:15:33","2025-07-06 19:59:58","","","","","","","International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This task can be made possible only through the construction of a shared ontology of the city, which allows the interoperability of different data systems.The DWs, originally developed in mechanical and process engineering, allow to construct a digital model of a physical object or process, to monitor its real-time performance, to perform maintenance tasks and to test the effects of planned changes. However, when extending the notion of the DW to complex cultural and social entities such as cities, it is important to consider also issues of inclusivity and citizen participation. How can the DW be conceptualised not only as a tool of technological control or narrative, but as an instrument to empower not only institutions but also citizens?

The purpose is to integrate 3D printing technology with intangible cultural heritage-related cultural and creative products in the new era background, so as to achieve the double effects of economic benefits and cultural heritage. The connotation, characteristics, and types of egg carving handicraft are taken as the theoretical basis, and the innovation and development of egg carving cultural and creative products in Linxia city, Gansu Province, are taken as an example. Then, the innovation of egg carving handicraft technology is put forward, including the innovation of technique and expression form. On this basis, 3D printing technology is used, the hollow egg carving model which combines the characteristics of Gansu Linxia egg carving is designed, and 3D solid printing is carried out. The results show that the surface of the eggshell is not too bright and the effect is very subtle. The dark color of the eggshell can well set off the white font and white picture, and the calligraphy and knife method can be integrated and unified. The 3D modeling image of egg carving reveals that the selection of color and material can set off a better viewing effect. Moreover, the 3D printed hollow egg carving works have complete appearance and high artistic design, which has strong artistic effect and is in line with the special color of Gansu Linxia egg carving.

This claim is supported by three issues: 12 smart key concepts need to be considered in the evaluation, criteria importance, and data variation among these criteria. Thus, an MCDM solution is essential to overcome problem complexity. To end this, this study presents a decision‐making framework on the basis of the extension of interval type 2 trapezoidal‐fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency (IT2TR‐FWZIC) integrated with the Vlsekriterijumska Optimizcija I Kaompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method for evaluating and benchmarking the smart e‐tourism data management applications. Our methodology comprises two consecutive phases. In the first phase, a decision matrix is constructed using the intersection between the 12 key concepts and smart e‐tourism data management applications of each category and subcategory in smart e‐tourism. In the second phase, the integration of the IT2TR‐FWZIC formulation and VIKOR is presented to compute the weights for the 12 key concepts and benchmark the smart e‐tourism data management applications for each category. The results are as follows: (1) A clear difference is found among the criteria weights (12 smart key concepts). Specifically, the real‐time criterion achieves the highest importance weight (0.098), whereas augmented reality obtains the lowest weight (0.068). The context‐awareness and recommender systems have the same weight value (0.087), and the other eight criteria are distributed in between. (2) The smart e‐tourism data management applications are evaluated and benchmarked effectively per category and subcategories. (3) Benchmarked applications in each category are subjected to a systematic ranking in the evaluation process. The sensitivity analysis has shown high correlation outcomes to the systematic ranking results over the 31 scenarios of criteria weight changing.

Such strategies and processes increase energy efficiency, make it possible to use resources rationally, and lower maintenance and construction costs. In addition to using wireless technologies and sensors to improve thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort, “smart” buildings are known for their energy, materials, water, and land management systems. Smart buildings use wireless technologies and sensors to improve thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort. These systems are known for managing energy, materials, water, and land. The task of the study is to consider the indicators that form the basis of the framework for evaluating intelligent buildings. The indicators for the development of “smart” buildings are classified into six categories in this paper: green building construction, energy management systems, safety and security management systems, occupant comfort and health, building automation and control management systems, and communication and data sharing. The paper aims to develop a scoring model for the smartness of public buildings. In developing the scoring system, the decision-making process requires an appropriate selection of the optimal solution. The contents of the research are the methods known as the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PF-AHP), Interval Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy AHP with differences (IVPF-AHP d), and the proposed method Interval Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy AHP (IVPF-AHP p). The research focuses on the IVPF-AHP as one of the methods of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and its implementation.

Being the first Greek settlement in southern Italy, the site has great historical importance and offers unique historical elements such as the Cumaean Sibyl’s Cave. The analysis began with a 3D modeling of the slope through digital terrestrial photogrammetry, which forms a basis for a geomechanical analysis. Digital discontinuity measurements and cluster analysis provide data for kinematic analysis, which pointed out the planar, wedge and toppling failure potential. Subsequently, a propagation-based susceptibility analysis was completed into a GIS environment: it shows that most of the western sector of the site is susceptible to rockfall, including the access course, a segment of the Cumana Railroad and its local station. The work highlights the need for specific mitigation measures to increase visitor safety and the efficacy of filed-based digital reconstruction to support susceptibility analysis in rockfall prone areas.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:33","2025-07-05 19:34:14","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital technologies have reshaped the smart city paradigm in terms of both resilience and sustainability, capitalizing cities’ cultural and historical components while providing unique potential for growth in the real estate industry. Real estate, in particular, is considered a main asset to the tourist experience, whether it is in the form of hospitality accommodation facilities, urban landscapes, or cultural heritage hotspots. In addition, the effect of cultural sites and overall destination attractiveness on real estate dynamics (land/housing prices and building activity) is well established. Thus, uncovering how enhanced technological throughputs and synergies, culture-led urban sustainability initiatives and the real estate dimension are directly (or indirectly) associated could support cities to better delineate policies for their promotion as international, sustainable, and resilient tourist destinations. With this perspective, the present study focused on four particular cities’ successful smart initiatives, namely Amsterdam, Barcelona, Seoul, and Stockholm, in an attempt to identify how developers and local authorities will need to transform in order to offer better services to residents and visitors. This work reveals that smart projects alone cannot secure the transition of existing (European) cities into smart and sustainable tourism destinations. In addition, this study also contributes to public policy by demonstrating how challenging it is to be smart without the support and involvement of the local community, highlighting the significance of public awareness. The empirical findings suggest that local authorities are of critical importance when shaping a well-structured and practically effective strategy for the integration of sustainable and technologically advanced smart features. Results are promising, and final reflections provide insights for tourism destinations policymakers, city authorities, and real estate professionals.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:33","2025-07-05 19:33:10","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is not yet a complete analysis of the hot spots and trends in this area of research, nor has a complete workflow based on the practical application of HBIM been developed. In this article, we analyzed the research progress, hot spots, and trends in HBIM since 2010. We used the CiteSpace scientometric analysis tool to analyze 372 documents with high relevance to HBIM from the Web of Science core database using literature co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis, and keyword emergence detection. The findings show that research in the field of HBIM was still in the conceptualization stage during 2010–2017, and with the continuous development of various technologies, attention to HBIM has gradually accelerated since 2017 by expanding its uses to multidisciplinary fields such as artificial intelligence. In the cluster analysis of literature co-citations, 14 clusters were generated, and four clusters, semiautomatic 3D modeling, heritage information system, pilot study, and virtual reality, which have high rates of citation, are discussed in this paper. These clusters reflect the hot spots and frontiers of research in HBIM to a certain extent. In the “Discussion” section, a systematic and complete workflow of HBIM application to heritage architecture is proposed for three levels: modeling, data exchange, and auxiliary management. On this basis, the development of the field of heritage building conservation and sustainable development is analyzed to provide valuable theoretical and practical references to propose future research directions.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:33","2025-07-05 19:35:57","","","","","","","Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, most experts now agree that conservation management of heritage places based on a common understanding of their cultural values is essential to address all the particularities of their contexts. Recently, significant research has demonstrated the potential of Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) for the collaborative data management in conjunction with conservation projects. The recent development of HBIM web platforms illustrates the value of strengthening the link between the digital model and the physical realm of heritage assets. This paper advocates the application of Digital Twin’s (DT) principles, using HBIM models as a digital replica, to support the preventive conservation of heritage places. Based on an extensive literature review, a comprehensive framework that integrates the DT into the management plan process for the preventive conservation of built heritage is proposed. Several recommendations for its implementation are finally discussed, such as the identification of tangible features of significance, the threats associated with their integrity and the corresponding mitigation strategies, with particular emphasis on the value assessment process. The result is a data model for structuring information on preventive conservation strategies. This framework provides the basis for future implementation and demonstrates the need for a DT approach in this context.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:33","2025-07-06 19:58:37","","","","","","","Isprs International Journal of Geo-Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jean Baudrillard’s take on the Fable of Borges suggests a replacement of the physical world by a virtual experiencing life, setting the tone for a pessimistic and somewhat fearful attitude towards technological development. On the verge of the dissemination of disruptive innovations that can be described under the “umbrella” of Internet of Things (IoT), we observe not a replacement, but a deep and complex intertwining of online and offline experiences, sketching the contours of what can become a phygital society. This alternative conceptualization of our contemporary society, combined with the possibilities of technological development, affords new opportunities for the expression and experiencing of culture, and also for the creative industries. In our research, we explore the impact of one augmented reality (AR) app designed for one of the landmarks of the Portuguese cultural heritage, Quinta da Regaleira. We explored this single-case study using qualitative data collection techniques, aiming to discuss the positive and negative outcomes of this innovation, both for the dynamizing of cultural heritage, and for the visitors. The article provides useful information for heritage spaces that wish to follow this path. It describes the main steps to be taken in the production of content and provides examples of the narrative model that helps people to visit the space and obtain information, knowing stories relevant to the past and present of the cultural heritage.

Recently, a few in situ methodologies to diagnose the thermal parameters of buildings have been considered. However, because of their limitations such as low accuracy, limited number of measurements, and the high cost of monitoring devices, researchers are seeking a new alternative. In this study, a novel hyper-efficient Arduino transmittance-meter was introduced to overcome these limitations and determine the thermal parameters of building envelopes. Unlike conventional methodologies, the proposed transmittance-meter is based on synchronized measurements of different parameters necessary to estimate the transmittance parameter. To verify the applicability of the transmittance-meter, an experimental study was conducted wherein a temperature-controlled box model was thermally monitored, and the outputs of the transmittance-meter employed were compared with those captured by a commercial device. The results revealed a high level of reduction in cost and a low range of difference compared with the latter, thereby validating the applicability of the proposed thermal monitoring system.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:33","2025-07-05 01:27:46","","","","","","","Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, natural deterioration linked to the passage of time affects ancient artifacts and buildings. Sometimes, the deterioration compromises the functionality of cultural assets, pushing them toward decay. In this scenario, effective intervention seems impossible on the various critical points because of the wide variability of factors involved and the wide range of possible treatments. However, the spread of low-cost technologies has led to the possibility of having different devices and sensors able to communicate and interact with each other and humans: the Internet of Things (IoT). In this scenario, the IoT paradigm makes it possible to map reality by defining a coherent virtual representation (Digital Twin), which could help preserve Cultural Heritage. This work introduces an IoT-based system combining monitoring, predictive maintenance, and decision-making regarding the implementable interventions for protecting cultural heritage buildings. For this purpose, deep and machine learning techniques allow for the detection and classification of damages on specific materials.

The refined pruning operation is based on the channel-wise importance indexes of each layer and the layer-wise input sparsity of convolutional layers. The method utilizes the characteristics of the native networks without introducing any extra workloads to the training phase. In addition, the operation is easy to be extended to various state-of-the-art deep neural networks. The effectiveness of the method is verified on ResNet architecture and VGG networks in terms of dataset CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet100. Experimental results show that in terms of ResNet50 on CIFAR10 and ResNet101 on CIFAR100, more than 85% of parameters and Floating-Point Operations are pruned with only 0.35% and 0.40% accuracy loss, respectively.

It is observed a change on the energy policies promoting the energy efficiency, encouraging an active role of the consumer, instructing them about the importance of the consumer behavior and protecting consumer rights. Electricity is gaining room as energy source; its share will keep increasing constantly in the following decades. The objective behind this energy consumption segmentation is to be able to provide personalized recommendations to each group in order to reduce their energy consumption and the associated costs, fostering energy efficiency measures and improving the consumer engagement.

Data must be accurately represented with aesthetically pleasing visuals and engaging text to effectively communicate to the intended audience. Data storytelling has received much attention lately, but as of yet, it does not have a theoretical and practical foundation in information science. A data story adds context, narrative, and structure to the visual representation of data, providing audiences with character, plot, and a holistic experience of narrative. This paper proposes a methodological approach to transform a data visualization into a data story based on the Data‐Information‐Knowledge‐Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid and the S‐DIKW Framework. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid, the proposed approach defines a strategy to represent insights extracted from data. Data is then turned into information by identifying character(s) facing a problem, adding textual and graphic content; information is turned into knowledge by organizing what happens as a plot.

In this work, we present a methodology for precise 3D modelling and multi-source geospatial data blending for the purposes of Virtual Reality immersive and interactive experiences. We evaluate it on the volcanic island of Santorini due to its formidable geological terrain and the interest it poses for scientific and touristic purposes. The methodology developed here consists of three main steps. Initially, bathymetric and SRTM data are scaled down to match the smallest resolution of our dataset (LIDAR). Afterwards, the resulted elevations are combined based on the slope of the relief, while considering a buffer area to enforce a smoother terrain. As a final step, the orthophotos are combined with the estimated Digital Terrain Model, via applying a nearest neighbour matching schema leading to the final terrain background. In addition to this, both onshore and offshore points-of-interest were modelled via image-based 3D reconstruction and added to the virtual scene. The overall geospatial data that need to be visualized in applications demanding photo-textured hyper-realistic models pose a significant challenge. The 3D models are treated via a mesh optimization workflow, suitable for efficient and fast visualization in virtual reality engines, through mesh simplification, physically based rendering texture maps baking, and level-of-details.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:34","2025-07-06 20:00:11","","","","","","","The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The individualization and diversification of tourism resources must be supported by a powerful information resource management system. However, the traditional tourism information resource management system has some problems, such as scattered sources of tourism information, low interactivity, and slow update of information resources. Tourists cannot get detailed information of scenic spots and make detailed plans for tourism which hinder the further development of the tourism industry. In order to solve these problems and promote the development of the tourism industry, this paper carried out digital management of tourism information based on machine learning and digital management of information resources of different tourist attractions and surveyed and tested the number of tourists, expenditure of scenic spots, income of scenic spots, and satisfaction of tourists. The total result showed that the digital management of tourism information resources in scenic spots can increase the passenger flow, increase the income of scenic spots, reduce the expenditure of scenic spots by 6.7%, and increase the satisfaction of tourists by 4.1%. The digital management of tourism information resources based on machine learning can optimize the tourism industry and promote its development.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:34","2025-07-06 19:59:32","","","","","","","International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RETRATADO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regarding fire detection, Depth Separable Convolution (DSC) and multi-scale detection structure are introduced to improve the You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) model. Moreover, the DSC-Anchor-Isoft-Non Maximum Suppression-YOLO (DAI-YOLO) model is implemented for the fire detection of scenic spots. The experimental results show that the precision, recall, and average precision of the DAI-YOLO model are 92.1%, 84.2%, and 84.6%, respectively, compared with other models, a minimum increase of 4.1%, 8.8%, and 6.0%, with higher detection accuracy and performance. Based on the analysis of tourist satisfaction, a comprehensive index system is constructed using the grounded theory of text mining, and emotion analysis is integrated into the satisfaction evaluation to reveal tourists' evaluation of scenic spots more comprehensively. According to the analysis, the environmental factor receives the highest satisfaction rating, reaching a positive rate of 98.78%. However, the satisfaction evaluation of scenic spot management is relatively low, accounting for 6.06% of the negative evaluation. The importance-satisfaction analysis reveals that the key factors affecting tourist satisfaction are traffic level, scenic spot tickets, and service. The results of this study provide valuable reference for the managers and researchers of scenic spots and are expected to contribute to the construction of a safer and more satisfying tourism experience.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:35","2025-07-05 19:27:14","","","","","","","Ieee Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government's efforts to enhance the welfare and lifestyle of citizens have been partially undermined by a significant rise in energy intensity, resulting in increased energy consumption. Over the years, researchers have utilized historical energy consumption data to enhance energy efficiency through various technologies. Innovative smart technologies drive energy efficiency, reducing energy usage throughout all areas of the energy industry, from production and supply to consumption. This creates a balance in all sectors and indicates a decrease in energy demand in all areas of building infrastructure. Green buildings that utilize Internet of Things (IoT) technology employ sensors and software to collect data, optimizing, and enhancing building performance. This includes reducing energy and electricity consumption, improving air quality, and optimizing lighting throughout the day. These buildings can contribute to reaching zero‐energy building targets. It becomes challenging to manage green buildings without using centralized control. Therefore, managing and integrating these buildings with intelligent technologies is vital in achieving environmentally friendly management. This study offers a broad overview of the green building concept and explores the use of the green IoT in enhancing services and conserving energy within green buildings. The article aims to deliver an extensive review of green buildings and their advantages, analyze the technology behind the IoT and its integration with solar panels to lower energy consumption, and ultimately identify the challenges present in this area of research.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:35","2025-07-06 19:55:15","","","","","","","Energy Science &Amp; Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the analysis of the current situation of the tourism cultural and creative projects in the traditional block, this method combines the RMP analysis theory and the tourist satisfaction theory to study the local cultural elements and the satisfaction of tourism cultural and creative projects with the IPA model. The results are as follows: sightseeing (42.5%) is the highest motivation of tourists, followed by cultural and creative experience (16.2%), of which 84.8% are self-help tourists, and only 2.3% choose to join the group. Life custom is a significant factor influencing the satisfaction of patients who think it is very important but are actually dissatisfied. Smart tourism and creative tourism projects are considered important by the respondents, but there is a large difference between expectations and perceptions. These are the projects that managers need to focus on to correct at present.

The need has grown high for such systems with the advent of digitization and the web era. Computer systems and web have offered easier retrieval of information in almost no time. However, as the amount of data increased, these systems were not able to work well in terms of accuracy and precision of retrieval. Semantic Web concept was introduced to overcome the issue by converting the web of documents to a web of data. Semantic Web technologies makes data machine-understandable so that information retrieval can be more precise and accurate. The Cultural Heritage (CH) community, with the goal of preserving and dissemination of the historical information to people and society, is one of the first domains to adopt Semantic Web recommendations and technologies, which can provide interoperability between various organizations by creating a shared understanding in the community. The data in the CH domain differs widely with types and formats. Also, a lot of organizations and experts from various fields interact through different processes within this community. Due to the mentioned needs, the CH community employed Semantic Web technologies step by step along its evolution process for better knowledge management and a uniform understanding among the community. In this study, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework that spans cultural heritage, information modeling, and information retrieval. Our model addresses early solutions in knowledge organization systems, highlighting the evolution from classification systems and controlled vocabularies to the significance of metadata schemas. We delve into the limitations of traditional knowledge organization systems and the necessity of formal ontologies, particularly in the cultural heritage domain. The comparative analysis of CRM vs. EDM, ontology-based metadata interoperability, and ontology technologies elucidate our contributions to the field. This paper outlines the process from the initial steps of adopting Semantic Web technologies in the CH domain to the latest developments in CH information retrieval. In this paper, we also reviewed intelligent applications and services developed in the CH domain after establishing semantic data models and Knowledge Organization Systems. Finally, challenges and possible future research directions are discussed. The findings revealed that GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) are excellent and comprehensive sources of CH information. The CH community has put in a lot of time and effort to develop data models and knowledge organization tools; now it's time to use this valuable resource to construct smart applications that are still in their early phases. This could benefit the CH industry even more.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:35","2025-07-17 18:28:58","","","","","","","Ieee Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\FUC3Z6XT\Babak Ranjgar et al. - 2024 - Cultural Heritage Information Retrieval Past, Present, and Future Trends.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The formation of ethnic groups is mostly due to external and internal reasons, with a complex mechanism structure. When people’s environment is destroyed, this value identity will be stronger, national cohesion and solidarity will grow sharply, an unprecedented high. Minority languages are characterized by a wide variety, cultural generation, and dynamic evolution. The languages are complex and diverse, and are deeply influenced by their cultural heritage. This has led to the fact that for a long time, minority languages have been learned almost exclusively by people of their own ethnic group. This has led to a steady decline in the number of minority language speakers. However, the birth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has created an opportunity for the development of minority languages. Foreign minority languages have the following status (1) rapid decline (2) many endangered languages (3) low willingness to learn. In order to further investigate the current situation of minority language protection, the team conducted a survey in the minority cluster A. The results of the survey are as follows: most of the villagers are in love with the ethnic language and must inherit and promote the ethnic language, which is the wealth of a nation, but there are also a few residents who think that Mandarin should be used to replace the ethnic language. This reflects that most of the residents love the national language, but their young people as the inherited generation lose their love for the national language and are not willing to inherit and promote it. To solve this problem, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based ethnic language data system has been constructed so that the data system for ethnic minority language protection built through IoT technology can become the last line of defense for protecting ethnic languages, while allowing ethnic languages to be known and understood by more people through IoT technology, fostering the love and reverence of ethnic minority people for ethnic languages, and enhancing other ethnic groups’ sense of identity and support for ethnic languages. We propose to protect minority languages. Ultimately, we propose recommendations for the preservation of minority languages. (1) Increase publicity for minority language preservation. (2) Construct laws and regulations related to minority language protection. (3) Conduct in-depth research on minority language work and build an information base. (4) Promote minority language education.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:35","2025-07-06 20:01:34","","","","","","","Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Britain and the United States, as established Western capitalist powers, have developed rapidly in economy, technology, and education. Many countries are learning English. In English teaching, British and American cultures inevitably penetrate back into them. This article mainly studies the infiltration of British and American cultures in English teaching. This paper mainly uses the big data analysis method of intelligent Internet of things, and uses survey, interview and statistical technology to analyze and study the culture and language between different nationalities in the United States and Britain. It tries to investigate and analyze the role of language and culture in infiltration; conduct practical investigations on the meaning of English teaching, the significance of cultural infiltration, and the specific manifestations of cultural differences, and collect experimental data. Experimental data show that the study of the penetration of British and American cultures in English teaching not only requires a certain cultural foundation as a background, but also shows the differences in knowledge understanding in teaching due to different cultural backgrounds. Experimental data show that after a thorough understanding of British and American cultures, teaching efficiency in English teaching has increased by 20%, and student satisfaction with English classes has increased by about 35%. Only with a realistic understanding of the differences and unity of British and American cultures can we truly make English teaching smoother.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:35","2025-07-05 19:39:31","","","","","","","International Journal of New Developments in Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the increasing frequency and severity of natural and man-made disasters constantly strike the cultural heritage sites with significant damages. In this article, we focus on a cultural heritage damage assessment (CHDA) problem where the goal is to accurately locate the damaged area of a cultural heritage site using the imagery data posted on social media during a disaster event by exploring the collective strengths of both AI and human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems. Unlike other infrastructure-based solutions, social media platforms provide a more pervasive and scalable solution to acquire timely cultural heritage damage information during disaster events. Our work is motivated by the limitation of current AI solutions that fail to accurately model the complex cultural heritage damage due to the lack of essential human cultural knowledge to differentiate various damage types and identify the actual causes of the damage. Two critical technical challenges exist in solving our problem: 1) it is challenging to effectively detect the problematic cultural heritage damage estimation of AI in the absence of ground truth labels and 2) it is nontrivial to acquire accurate cultural background knowledge from the potentially unreliable crowd workers to effectively address the failure cases of AI. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we develop CollabLearn, an uncertainty-aware crowd-AI collaborative assessment system that explicitly explores the human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems to identify and fix AI failure cases and boost the damage assessment accuracy in CHDA applications.

After closer examination, a reference corpus of 40 contributions was evaluated in detail and classified along with their variants of DT—content-, communication-, and collaboration-centric and risk-informed ViMs. Their system features correlate with different application areas (AA), new or improved technologies—mostly still under development—and sensors used. Our proposal suggests a template-based, generative approach to DTs using standardized metadata formats, expert/curator software and customers’/visitors’ engagement. It advocates for stakeholders’ collaboration as part of a comprehensive validation and verification assessment (V&amp;VA) throughout the DT’s entire life cycle.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:36","2025-07-17 18:29:19","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\5LBWGTDQ\Wolfram Luther et al. - 2023 - Digital Twins and Enabling Technologies in Museums and Cultural Heritage An Overview.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the transversal vision and the multidisciplinary interpretation have been attributed to BIM models, in the field of monumental structures, these databases can be organized in different ways depending on the adopted protocol and classifications for the required output of the work. In this manuscript, an H-BIM approach targeted at collecting and providing useful information to execute seismic vulnerability analyses of monumental structures is presented. The BIM modeling followed a protocol based on the following steps: geometrical acquisitions, scan-to-BIM modeling, and informative data collection. The methodology has been applied to the oldest part of Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (IT), an important monumental masonry structure representing the political headquarter of the city since the Middle Ages. The parametric modeling was realized classifying the information according to structural perspectives based on the cognitive steps for the investigation of the existing structures. Finally, a seismic assessment has been realized through a simplified procedure developed for cultural heritage buildings. The outcomes of the evaluation are still part of the collected information of the H-BIM model, as an example of continuous improvement of the available contents of the database.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:36","2025-07-17 18:27:04","","","","","","","Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\HV7DTHYP\Vieri Cardinali et al. - 2023 - An Oriented H-Bim Approach for the Seismic Assessment of Cultural Heritage Buildings Palazzo Vecchi.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the forms in which they display cultural heritage might not be the most effective at piquing visitors’ interest. Therefore, museums tend to integrate different technologies that aim to create engaging and memorable experiences. In this context, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology results particularly promising due to the possibility of implementing smart objects in museums, granting exhibits advanced interaction capabilities. Gamification techniques are also a powerful technique to draw visitors’ attention. These often rely on interactive question-based games. A drawback of such games is that questions must be periodically regenerated, and this is a time-consuming task. To confront these challenges, this paper proposes a low-maintenance gamified smart object platform that automates the creation of questions by exploiting semantic web technologies. The platform has been implemented in a real-life scenario. The results obtained encourage the use of the platform in the museum considered. Therefore, it appears to be a promising work that could be extrapolated and adapted to other kinds of museums or cultural heritage institutions.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:36","2025-07-17 18:29:23","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\PDWVGES7\Alejandro López-Martínez et al. - 2020 - Empowering Museum Experiences Applying Gamification Techniques Based on Linked Data and Smart Object.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, VR theory is made into an image-based 3-dimensional (3D) modeling process. Secondly, the interactive behavior information data is analyzed according to the theory of deep learning and edge computing. Finally, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to analyze the predicted temperature with the wellness building space model, as well as to make a study based on the changes in the user’s psychological indicators. The results show that the model predictions of deep learning-edge computing are most like the actual environmental settings. Both PSO and deep learning algorithms have varying degrees of influence on the final prediction results. The average temperature of the wellness building space established by deep learning and edge computing is 24.58 degrees, the average measured value of the actual environment is 24.49 degrees, and the predicted values of the two are similar. While users experienced the interactive design of the health building, their heart rate dropped from 73.17 to 68.79 and gradually became stable. There is no obvious change in the user’s heart rate, which reflects the comfort of the wellness building space designed based on deep learning and VR interaction.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:36","2025-07-06 19:47:11","","","","","","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the Internet of Things (IoT) background, the impact of sports events on the economy and culture of the host city is explored based on the idea of edge computing. In addition, the economic and cultural impact of the current highest level sports event—the Olympic Games—on the host country is also analyzed. The results show that the more large-scale events are held, the more they can promote the development of the high-end market of urban tourism. The hosting of the Beijing Olympic Games brought Beijing $3.127 billion in revenue and great changes in humanities, ecology, living environment, and other aspects. The higher the gross domestic product (GDP) of a domestic city is, the more events will be held in this city, and the two are positively correlated. Domestic competition resources are concentrated in these cities with strong economic strength. The total number of events held by the top 10 cities in GDP accounts for 64.1% of the top 30 cities. Geographically, among the cities that have hosted sports events, there are 89 cities in the east, with a total number of 1676 events, accounting for 64% of the national events, far exceeding the central and western cities, and even far exceeding the sum of the latter two. Therefore, it can be said that the holding of sports events reflects the comprehensive strength of a city and improves the city’s exposure and popularity. The exploration provides a certain reference value for cities to enhance their influence with the help of events.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:36","2025-07-05 19:24:38","","","","","","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internet technology simplifies and compresses the marketing process, making consumers sovereign, and the monopoly of traditional media is difficult to reproduce on the Internet. The development of the times has also affected people’s pursuit of “beauty,” and their willingness to consume for design has gradually increased. Based on this, this paper proposes a design method that integrates the marketing concept based on the product design concept and the art design. The Internet of Things is based on the development of the Internet, expands on the basis of the Internet, and extends to people’s daily life with physical devices. It is widely welcomed by various research fields at present. This paper studies the changes brought by the Internet, the integration and innovation of art design and marketing concepts in the Internet age, and the development advantages and changes of traditional product design in information dissemination. Based on this, this paper proposes a user-centered, user-participated design. The experimental results show that the user-participative design method based on the integration of marketing concepts and artistic design and the innovation of functions can be effectively improved by paying attention to user feedback, which can bring good user experience effects.

In Italy, the safeguarding of historic masonry buildings from seismic events has drawn the attention of researchers, often underestimating other external factors. This may be due to the fact that, over the centuries, earthquakes have frequently destroyed entire cities. In order to preserve and monitor historical and cultural heritage, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, associated with maintenance and classification projects such as CARTIS, have been introduced in recent years. These systems guarantee not only the monitoring and maintenance of the single building but also a large-scale control of an urban neighbourhood. The purpose of this paper is to define a preliminary SHM system capable of preserving cities from catastrophic events other than earthquakes, focusing on the study of the phenomenon of river flooding. This is addressed by proposing a monitoring system based on smart nodes implementing new mathematical modelling to foreseen floods.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:36","2025-07-05 19:37:35","","","","","","","Journal of Physics Conference Series","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the data collected from SHM are essential to plan cost-effective and sustainable maintenance solutions, in compliance with the basic preservation principles for historic buildings, such as minimum intervention. It is evident that, compared to new buildings, the application of SHM to CHS is even more challenging because of the uniqueness of each monitored structure and the need to respect its architectural and historical value. This paper aims to present a state-of-the-art evaluation of the current traditional and innovative SHM techniques adopted for CHS and to identify future research trends.

Preserving and giving value to the cultural heritage of a region can pave the way for local as well as regional development. This includes tangible, intangible and the natural heritage of cities. It is necessary to develop a cultural infrastructure plan along with other aspects such as transportation, built, green and grey in frastructure. Cultural infrastructure refers to places where culture is experienced, participated in or showcased in. This includes the existing cultural heritage of a place as well as the planning of spaces for cultural stimulation and involvement. With the advent of fourth industrial revolution smart cities are gradually becoming the way of life across the world. The Smart City uses Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) to effectively manage transportation, water services, waste disposal, energy and other community services. In this scenario it becomes imperative to have strategic infrastructure planning. Indian Government has recently launched the Smart City Mission in India and several smart city projects are underway across the country. It becomes necessar y in this context that Indian cities with their rich tradition and cultural heritage do not lose their unique identity in this process of transformation into smart cities. Even as smart city projects stress the need for heritage preservation there is a lot of ambiguity in how they can be integrated and used to advance urban intelligence. The technologies of the smart city have considerable potential to be used for the management and enhancement its cultural heritage and can help in the creation of a cultural infrastructure plan. This paper will examine the significance of cultural infrastructure in future cities and how it can be integrated into the city planning process of Indian cities through the study of relevant case studies from around the world.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-06 20:01:44","","","","","","","E3s Web of Conferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How to extract valuable knowledge accurately and conveniently from the massive medical records of TCM is one of the important issues in the current research on the development of TCM. Due to the large amount of data of TCM medical records, many feature attributes, and diverse patterns, the existing classification technology has high computational complexity, low mining efficiency, and poor universality. Therefore, this paper proposed to quantify the medical records of TCM and obtained the main symptoms according to the improved hierarchical clustering feature selection algorithm. This paper also proposed a support vector machine (SVM) classification method using improved particle swarm algorithm to classify TCM information, which not only improves the efficiency and accuracy of TCM information classification but also discovers the potential dialectical and symptom patterns in diagnosis and treatment, so that the intangible cultural heritage protection of TCM can be developed sustainably. This paper showed that the information acquisition accuracy of the improved algorithm was very high. Before the improved algorithm was used, the accuracy of information mining for TCM was 67.90% at the highest and 65.53% at the lowest, but after using the improved algorithm, the accuracy rate of information mining for TCM was 88.02% at the highest and 82.45% at the lowest. It can be seen that using the improved algorithm to mine TCM information can quickly process effective information.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-05 19:34:44","","","","","","","Biomed Research International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RETRATADO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the development of society and the passage of time, these precious traditional musical cultural heritages inevitably face the dilemma of gradual depletion or even disappearance. In the digital age, effectively protecting and inheriting these musical cultural heritages has become an urgent problem to be addressed. Therefore, this paper proposes an application method based on digital twin technology, exploring how to protect and inherit musical cultural heritages through digital twin technology. By leveraging digital twin technology, a virtual museum dedicated to showcasing the richness and historical connotations of music cultures is created, preserving and simulating the soundscapes of historical music eras. Through the integration of audio archives, 3D modeling, and interactive displays, users can immerse themselves in the experience of historical music in the digital space. This paper evaluates the feasibility and cultural preservation value of this digital music history museum through the creation of music digital twin technology instances and user survey feedback and discusses the prospects of digital twins in the field of musical cultural heritage.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-17 18:30:50","","","","12","13","","Electronics","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","WOS:001256128000001","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\N7JTN6RB\Changman Zou et al. - 2024 - Sounds of History A Digital Twin Approach to Musical Heritage Preservation in Virtual Museums.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The driving factor of this framework was the fact that the presence of security cameras has become universal, including at sites of cultural heritage. ARTYCUL used the video streams of closed-circuit televisions (CCTV) cameras installed in such premises to detect human figures, and their coordinates with respect to the camera frames were used to visualize the density of visitors around the specific display items. Such a framework that can display the popularity of artifacts would aid the curators towards a more optimal organization. Moreover, it could also help to gauge if a certain display item were neglected due to incorrect placement. While items of similar interest can be placed in vicinity of each other, an online recommendation system may also use the reputation of an artifact to catch the eye of the visitors. Artificial intelligence-based solutions are well suited for analysis of internet of things (IoT) traffic due to the inherent veracity and volatile nature of the transmissions. The work done for the development of ARTYCUL provided a deeper insight into the avenues for applications of IoT technology to the cultural heritage domain, and suitability of ML to process real-time data at a fast pace. While we also observed common issues that hinder the utilization of IoT in the cultural domain, the proposed framework was designed keeping in mind the same obstacles and a preference for backward compatibility.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-06 20:06:58","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their potential benefits, the high failure rates and unmet expectations of co-opetition networks highlight a significant gap in the empirical frameworks for establishing and maintaining these networks. This research seeks to address these gaps by developing a framework that enhances value cocreation in the Portuguese ornamental stone sector, integrating the latest developments in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic), and service science. Question: How can a framework integrating IIoT, S-D Logic, and service science enhance value cocreation and manage co-opetition among SMEs in the Portuguese ornamental stone sector? Methods: Theoretical insights and practical applications were synthesized to develop and validate a comprehensive co-opetition framework. This framework was tested through an experimental pilot project in the Portuguese ornamental stone sector, leveraging IIoT. Results: The implementation of the framework demonstrated significant operational efficiency, including enhanced performance, reduced production variance, and better resource utilization, indicating that integrating IIoT within co-opetition networks can effectively support SMEs. Conclusions: This study confirms the transformative impact of embedding IIoT in co-opetition networks, offering a replicable and scalable framework for other sectors. This framework addresses the empirical gap and aligns with broader socio-economic goals, setting the stage for further research into its applicability and potential across diverse industrial environments.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-06 20:04:13","","","","","","","Administrative Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lack of economic opportunities and difficult access to services discourage people from settling there. The various problems that characterise Finiq are mainly is isolation as it's difficult to reach it; the lack of identity due to depopulation and the lack of economic activities; the poor development and preservation of historical heritage as well as the deterioration of the landscape due to climate change and unsustainable human activities. Intervention in the landscape and cultural heritage can play a crucial role in mitigating these problems. Creating connecting paths, parks, rest areas, restoring historical buildings and monuments, together with the development of cultural programmes, could on the one hand provide Finiq residents with a sense of Identity and belonging to the area thus contributing to the promotion and preservation of the cultural heritage; on the other hand, stimulate tourism and investments which would be beneficial to the local economy. Digitalisation, in particular the use of block- chain technology, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the Internet of Things (loT) could further mitigate these issues. Blockchain can be used for the provision of a secure and trans- parent register of historical and cultural heritage, thus facilitating access to information and knowledge about this heritage by citizens and tourists. At the same time, BIM can digitally represent the various areas of the city for easier and more timely planning of interventions in the landscape, built environment and cultural heritage. Creating a Digital Twin of the city of Finiq allows the different stakeholders to collaborate and exchange detailed and up-to-date information on the city's infrastructure and heritage, thus ensuring the quality of interventions and better management of the heritage itself. loT, through sensor technology, would enable the collection of real-time data on the state of preservation of cultural heritage and the use of resources. The data collected and exchanged with and certi- fied by a blockchain platform would increase transparency and citizen participation in cultural heritage management. Furthermore, loT can provide information on weather conditions and the impact of human activities on cultural heritage, serving as a useful tool for informed, data- driven decisions towards heritage conservation and enhancement. In summary, digitisation, in particular the proposed technologies, could prevent the deterioration of cultural heritage, pro- mote its knowledge and optimise the management of resources while promoting sustainable development. The creation of digital management systems for heritage and tourism activities is envisaged. However, the use of such technologies presents some barriers including the lack of adequate technological infrastructure and the need to train people involved in the use of such tools. The redevelopment of Finiq requires a balance between using the technology and understanding its limitations while analysing the needs and concerns of the community.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-06 19:58:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Limited access to large-format paintings is a challenge to restoration scientists seeking to obtain information quickly, in a non-destructive and non-invasive manner, and identify regions of interest. Therefore, we put forward two unique software tools based on multispectral imaging techniques, with the long-term aim to assess the artist’s intentions, creative process, and colour palette. This development paves the way for a comprehensive and multidisciplinary understanding of the mysteries encompassed in each pictorial layer, through the study of their physical and chemical characteristics. We conducted the first ever study on Musas I and Musas II, two large-format paintings by Italian artist Carlo Ferrario, located in the National Theatre of Costa Rica. In this study, we used our novel imaging techniques to choose regions of interest in order to study sample layers; while also assessing the works’ state of conservation and possible biodeterioration. We explored the applications of our two versatile software tools, RegionOfInterest and CrystalDistribution, and confirmed paint stratigraphies by means of microscopy and spectroscopy analyses (OM, SEM-EDX, Fluorescent microscopy, FTIR-ATR and micro-Raman). In a pilot study, we identified the artist’s main colour palette: zinc white, lead white, chrome yellow, lead read, viridian, along with artificial vermilion and ultramarine pigments. We were able to identify artificial vermilion and ultramarine and distinguish them from the natural pigments using CrystalDistribution to map the average size and diameter of the pigment crystals within the paint layers. This study demonstrated that software-based multidisciplinary imaging techniques are novel in establishing preventive and non-invasive methods for historical painting conservation studies, in addition, this study provides tools with great potential to be used in the future in applications such as virtual restoration.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-05 19:34:31","","","","","","","Scientific Reports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Semantic Web is the next step in the evolution of the Web. The semantic web improves online technologies in need of generating, distributing, and linking material. In literature, multiple surveys have been done on the semantic web (Web 3.0), but those surveys are limited to some specific topics. According to the best of our understanding, none of the surveys provides a comprehensive study about the applications, challenges, and future of the semantic web along with its relationship with the Internet of things (IoT). The previous surveys focused on the Web 3.0 without touching on applications or challenges or focused on only the application prospect of the web 3.0, focused on the just the challenges, or focused on web 3.0 relationship with either internet of things or knowledge graphs but failed to touch the other important factors i.e., failed to provide comprehensive web 3.0 survey. This survey paper covers the gaps created from the previous survey papers in the same field and provides a comprehensive survey about web 3.0, a comparison between web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, the study of application and challenges in web 3.0, the relationship between web 3.0 with IoT and knowledge graph. Moreover, it focuses on the evolution of the web, and semantic web along with an explanation of the various layers, ontology tools, and semantic web tools with their comparison and semantic web service search.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies evaluating the actual benefits of such technology on visitors’ experiences, which is crucial to improve the IoT adoption in this field. To address this issue, we present an exploratory study we performed to understand whether and how an IoT-based game affects the experience of museum visitors. The game is played after a traditional guided tour; it was created following a meta-design approach to enable domain experts, such as museum professional guides, to adapt the game to specific visitors and/or situations. The study involved a total of 18 participants who took a guided tour of the Museum of Natural Sciences of the University of Bari and played the game afterward. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The study results show that playing the IoT-based game positively affects the experience of visitors and, in particular, their emotions. Visitor workload was also found to be greater than that of a guided tour, but this had no negative impact on visitor experience. The study findings have implications for the design and development of future IoT games to enhance engagement and to improve the experience of visitors at cultural heritage sites.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:37","2025-07-07 22:25:17","","","","","","","Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INCLUIR; NO_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These structures were generally poorly prepared for movement triggered by natural disasters, a situation further complicated in the case of earthquakes, as each building has a unique structural dynamic linked to its geometry, materials, method of construction and environmental conditions. The use of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems integrating monitoring techniques as well as inspection and structural analyses has gained great relevance in the appearance of low-cost IoT (Internet of Things) sensors on the market. In this paper, an IoT BIM-based solution is presented for real-time monitoring using low-cost sensors in the scope of building SHM systems. The case study takes place at the central body of the Palace of Monserrate, one of the most distinguished elements of the Cultural Landscape of Sintra. An H-BIM model was created in Autodesk Revit® software (version 2022 and 2023) based on a point cloud, and used as the basis for the numerical model developed in 3MURI. A MeM low-cost sensor was installed on the third floor of the central tower of the Monserrate Palace in Sintra, and the data gathered were recorded in the H-BIM model. The capacity to acquire real-time information on a structure’s vibration, both during normal operation and after an extraordinary occurrence, could allow the application of more effective maintenance and repair practices, resulting in lower operating costs and allowing for the best management of built cultural heritage.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:38","2025-07-17 18:26:31","","","","","","","Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\JDS76CUQ\Rita Machete et al. - 2023 - A BIM-Based Model for Structural Health Monitoring of the Central Body of the Monserrate Palace A F.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amid this tension, traditional philosophies such as Feng Shui &amp;ndash; long embedded in Chinese spatial planning &amp;ndash; remain underutilized in the context of smart city development. This study explores the integration of classical Chinese feng shui philosophy with advanced smart city technologies to develop a culturally sustainable approach to urbanization in modern China. While traditional Chinese feng shui philosophy, rooted in the principle of harmony between humanity and nature, has informed urban planning for centuries, it remains under-researched as a framework for applying modern smart city technologies. By combining cultural heritage with cutting-edge technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and green infrastructure, this research addresses the growing tension between urbanization and cultural preservation. Using a mixed-methods approach &amp;ndash; including case studies of Chinese cities such as Beijing and Hangzhou, spatial analysis through geographic information system mapping, and interviews with cultural experts and urban planners &amp;ndash; the study identifies key synergies and challenges in aligning feng shui principles (e.g., energy flow [Qi] and natural balance) with smart city objectives such as energy efficiency and sustainable resource use. The proposed model not only advances environmental and social sustainability but also reinforces Chinese cultural heritage in urban development. The findings demonstrate that it is possible to design cities that are both technologically advanced and culturally meaningful &amp;ndash; a model potentially replicable by other nations experiencing similar dilemmas. The study concludes with policy implications for urban planners and identifies areas for future research, such as the scalability of the framework and its adaptability across diverse cultural and geographic contexts.","2025","2025-07-05 00:15:38","2025-07-06 19:48:22","","","","","","","Journal of Chinese Architecture and Urbanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the art market is a gold mine for professional thieves. Every month, more than a thousand works of art are stolen in the world. The criminal art business ranks third after drug trafficking and the arms trade. The level of detection of crimes related to the theft of art objects is still negligibly low (only 1.5 % of court cases end in favor of the owners), the amount of money is colossal (according to general estimates, the global value of stolen works is 3.7 billion pounds), and the interest of the internal authorities of different countries in training specialized search personnel is scanty. The relevance of the presented topic lies in the fact that the globalization of international trade in cultural values and the high corruption component require improving customs administration and improving the quality of customs activities. Today, innovative technologies are able to automate the process of control over cultural values, speed up and simplify the process of interaction between foreign trade participants and customs authorities, as well as ensure complete safety of transportation of cultural heritage objects. Objective: to develop proposals for improving customs control over the movement of cultural property, in particular, by creating an information interdepartmental system for monitoring the movement of cultural property using blockchain technologies and the Internet of Things, which can provide greater transparency in the movement of art objects.

Internet of Things (IoT) techniques facilitate efficient recording and understanding of visitors’ spatial and temporal distribution in museums, and traditional visitor tracking applications use surveillance cameras or wireless connections with portable smart devices. However, these methods either involve privacy concerns or face the obstacle of getting natural behavioral data of all visitors. This paper explores an IoT monitoring methodology in the field of museum studies, proposing a commodity WiFi-based head counting framework that does not need the visitor to connect with any device. Our system analyzes the Channel State Information (CSI) amplitude fluctuations at the fixed receiver caused when visitors cross the line-of-sight (LoS) link. It enables multi-area visitor counting by achieving In-and-Out traffic detection at different sites with a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The method also allows for a rough classification of visitor types based on body size, and an extra transfer module is presented to reduce training time for increasing sensing scenarios. Over 2300 samples at 5 different sites were collected to test the usability. Experiment 1 implemented in 3 environments/deployments demonstrated that the proposed approach can be potentially implemented in variable sites of museums. It achieved high up to 95% and 99% accuracies for identifying the number and direction of people crossing, respectively. Experiment 2 sampled adults, children, and adult-child groups at a science museum and achieved approximately 89% classification accuracy of visitor types. Experiment 3 collected data for all cases in which up to 3 targets entered and exited simultaneously, and reached a recognition accuracy of around 88% for 9 different cases.

In this paper, we develop a bio-inspired algorithm which can automate the entire furnace monitoring and controlling system in order to eliminate the human intervention involved in the physical process. The algorithm is blended as a web-based remote application for the better control of the tasks involved, energy utilized, and its subsequent log-report maintenance. The entire system employs Wi-Fi communication for data transfer from device to cloud where the stored data including temperature log, forth coming schedule, and process graphic are maintained by the proposed algorithm to predict the machine failure at an earlier stage. The real-time prototype system is supported by a heat treatment process that is completely automated using IoT to monitor and maintain the temperature during the production of metal casting process.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:38","2025-07-05 01:36:52","","","","","","","Scientific Programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It automated the graphs of seasonal Temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) changes inside the heritage structures and seasonal Performance Index (PI) values. While utilizing line graphs of the existing T and RH change trends and a bar graph expressing the PI values, this study examined the current status of the conservation environment inside the WCHs throughout the year and its diagnosis. Consequently, at higher latitudes, the organic cultural heritage repeatedly experienced large T fluctuations, and the risk of physical and chemical degradation of the materials was greater. However, the RH showed significant seasonal differences, even within the same latitude, indicating that the impact of latitude was not significant. Therefore, the staff in charge must manage RH by considering the surrounding environmental conditions and adjusting the internal environment of the structures. The PI values for the year-round T and RH inside the heritages were confirmed to only be a maximum of approximately 60% of the environmental suitability for conservation throughout the year, depending on the season. The relationship between the germination and growth potential period of xerophilic fungi and the monthly internal temperature and humidity in five heritages located at different latitudes was analyzed. As a result, we could thus determine that four particular months of the year (June-September) represent the periods with the highest risk of damage from xerophilic fungi in the country, regardless of latitude.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:39","2025-07-17 18:29:25","","","","","","","Journal of the Korean Wood Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\TNY4S2WL\Ik-Gyun Im e Gyu-Seong Han - 2023 - Environmental Suitability for Conservation and the Risk Period for Fungal Damage of Wooden Cultural.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dimensions of ""extension"" and ""recurrence"" at geographic and technological levels affect the complexity of their knowledge process; they require systematic ways for their categorisation and comprehension to guarantee correct diagnosis and suitable rehabilitation. Recent applications involving Internet of Things (IoT) for the built Cultural Heritage have demonstrated the potentialities of three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system (GIS) models and structured databases in supporting complex degrees of knowledge for technicians, as well as management for administrators. Starting from such experiences, the work presents the setting up of a web-based platform to support the knowledge and management of systemic architectures, considering the geographical distribution of fabrics, natural and anthropic boundary conditions, and technical and administrative details. The platform takes advantage of digital models, machine and deep learning procedures and relational databases, in a GIS-based environment, for the recognition and categorisation of prevalent physical and qualitative features of systemic architectures, the recognition and qualification of dominant and recurrent decays and the management of recovery activities in a semi-automatic way. Specifically, the main digital objects used for testing the applied techniques and setting up the platform are based on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and mapped point clouds of the historical Telegraphic Towers located along the Madrid-Valencia path, resulting from the on-site investigations. Their choice is motivated by the high level of knowledge about the cases reached in the last years by the authors, allowing them to test rules within the decision support systems and innovative techniques for their decay mapping. As the experience has demonstrated, the systematisation of technical details and operative pipeline of methods and tools allow the normalisation and standardisation of the intervention selection process; this offers policymakers an innovative tool based on traditional procedures for conservation plans, coherent with a priority-based practice.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:39","2025-07-17 18:32:01","","","","","","","Virtual Archaeology Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\3NY8HJTJ\M.

There is a growing need for more ready access to available knowledge, based on new technologies and more feedback in a structured and continuous way. The complexity of buildings is increasing and new materials and constructive systems are being applied in new or existent buildings. The monitoring of buildings performance under real exposure conditions should be the basis of new trends in this field.Nowadays, a new concept of sustainable development, primarily based on the quality of life and lower impacts on the natural environment, increases the importance of having specific intervention criteria and methodologies based on a building pathology knowledge. The early detection of building failures can help in reducing conflicts and costs. Building pathology should have new insights about the Information and Communications Technology (ICT), internet of things, uncertainty and risk analysis, advanced diagnosis techniques and forensic engineering approaches, with a consensual approach in the scientific and technical community.Building pathology is a very ancient occurrence but it needs new approaches to be dealt with. The building stock has increased exponentially in the last century and there is a need for faster and more efficient ways to inspect, diagnose and maintain/rehabilitate current buildings with pathology problems. The challenge is therefore that of benchmarking and systemizing all procedures linked with building pathology and use advanced tools, knowledge and technologies to improve today's practice, by reaching out to professionals in the field.The International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction (CIB) is organized in Working Commissions. W086 -Building Pathology (https://cibworld.org/ commissions/w086-building-pathology/) is one of the longest-running commissions within CIB ""is essentially concerned with learning from past and current building pathology and encouraging the systematic application of that knowledge to the design, construction and management of buildings"".In order to boost the dissemination of all concepts concerning building pathology, W086 decided to champion a special issue in the International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation, a CIB-encouraged journal, entitled ""Building Pathology: The past, new approaches and opportunities"" (https://cibworld.org/building-pathology-the-past-new-approaches-andopportunities/).

However, most of the existing monitoring systems proposed for historic buildings are not for general digitization purposes that provide data for smart services employing, e.g., artificial intelligence with machine learning. In addition, considering that preserving historic buildings is a long-term process that demands preventive maintenance, a monitoring system requires stable and scalable storage and computing resources. In this paper, a digitalization framework is proposed for smart preservation of historic buildings. A sensing system following the architecture of this framework is implemented by integrating various advanced digitalization techniques, such as Internet of Things, Edge computing, and Cloud computing. The sensing system realizes remote data collection, enables viewing real-time and historical data, and provides the capability for performing real-time analysis to achieve preventive maintenance of historic buildings in future research. Field testing results show that the implemented sensing system has a 2% end-to-end loss rate for collecting data samples and the loss rate can be decreased to 0.3%. The low loss rate indicates that the proposed sensing system has high stability and meets the requirements for long-term monitoring of historic buildings.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:39","2025-07-17 18:26:45","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\25YGYJJ3\Zhongjun Ni et al. - 2021 - A Sensing System Based on Public Cloud to Monitor Indoor Environment of Historic Buildings.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development and urban planning of a modern city, nowadays, should be entrusted on the implementation of methods and techniques which require a management of complex information. The final goal is to support local authorities for the decision making. Finding data that are often heterogeneous but nevertheless connected to each other is useful to create a virtuous management model based on an empirical and objective study system. It will therefore be important to develop a system of data retrieval, analysis and management as accurate as possible, usable by all the actors involved in the governance of the territories. The article focuses on the implementation of an effective workflow for the management of complex urban data, the final goal of such framework, is the creation of a Smart City 3D Platform capable of providing innovative services for tax assessment and collection. In particular, it investigates over the potential of using spherical photogrammetry, to guarantee fast, low-cost and reliable acquisition time. The resulting 3D model has been then georeferenced with GNSS coordinates to ensure the desired precision, while the assessment of the model has been done using laser scanner data as a ground truth. The point cloud obtained from the processing can be managed and edited in a WEBGIS, which merges 2D (cadastral register) and 3D (point cloud) data. The project is the result of the collaboration between the Università Politecnica delle Marche and the Company Andreani Tributi srl, with the aim of collecting information about the advertising structures present in the city of Brescia (Italy) for tax assessment.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:39","2025-07-06 20:03:24","","","","","","","The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new perspective arises with the paradigm of Social Internet of Things (SIoT), that relies on the implementation of semi-independent communicating objects with cooperation assessed by social relations and social feedback. In this article, we present the development and expansion of the IoT concept towards SIoT in the context of the interactions between tourist services as communicating objects. As a proof-of-concept we propose a composition of services as virtualized social objects and the interaction between them, by taking into consideration the balance, trustworthiness, cooperation and synergy of services.

Despite varied levels and visible gaps between rural and urban regions in terms of technology usage, innovative initiatives have been created, which correspond to the needs and expectations of a technology-savvy public. As a starting point, a number of public institutions dealing with tangible cultural heritage (e.g. museums, palaces, temples, World Heritage Sites (WHS)) do use innovative digital tools in order to communicate to various audiences, as well as to enrich visitors’ experience, especially taking into consideration young generations. This paper will firstly examine the role of ICTs in intangible cultural heritage (ICH) (e.g. Batik, Wayang puppet theatre, etc.); secondly, the authors will explain how ICTs can help to communicate and promote the values, history, and significances of ICH products, both for locals and tourists, with the goal of raising awareness on cultural identity. However, the knowledge of ICH still requires contacts with its own communities and is vulnerable, as it can be exposed to excessive cultural commoditization through e-platforms.

Internet of Things (IoT) technology best suits automation in different domains, such as home automation, retail, industry, and transportation, to name but a few. While these domains are strongly characterized by implicit user interaction, more recently, automation has been adopted also for the provision of interactive and immersive experiences that actively involve the users. IoT technology thus becomes the key for Smart Interactive Experiences (SIEs), i.e., immersive automated experiences created by orchestrating different devices to enable smart environments to fluidly react to the final users’ behavior. There are domains, e.g., cultural heritage, where these systems and the SIEs can support and provide several benefits. However, experts of such domains, while intrigued by the opportunity to induce SIEs, are facing tough challenges in their everyday work activities when they are required to automate and orchestrate IoT devices without the necessary coding skills. This paper presents a design approach that tries to overcome these difficulties thanks to the adoption of ontologies for defining Event-Condition-Action rules. More specifically, the approach enables domain experts to identify and specify properties of IoT devices through a user-defined semantics that, being closer to the domain experts’ background, facilitates them in automating the IoT devices behavior. We also present a study comparing three different interaction paradigms conceived to support the specification of user-defined semantics through a “transparent” use of ontologies. Based on the results of this study, we work out some lessons learned on how the proposed paradigms help domain experts express their semantics, which in turn facilitates the creation of interactive applications enabling SIEs.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:39","2025-07-05 19:15:05","","","","","","","Personal and Ubiquitous Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This unique library hosts about 180.000 pieces, 500 of which are medieval manuscripts, 120 incunabulum, 5.000 editions of the 16th century – among others, as well as an ancient Musical Archive. The library is located in the heart of Naples, in a magnificent place where a series of initiative are already taking place, as a collaboration between the University of Naples Federico II and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage. All these features make Library of Girolamini a rare case study in the field of ancient books. The project aims at a complete digitization of the books; however, the important part of the project is the creation of full sets of metadata with a complete history of the documents and of the studies about the document itself. The first books to be considered will be a set of 512 manuscripts of the XIII century, e.g. a fully illustrated Divina Commedia or Seneca’s tragedies with miniature paintings. There will be two main streams of work: a conservation and study of ancient books through the digitization in a proper file format namely the FITS Flexible Image Transport System; b grant the access to this information in the Big Data era using such technologies as Internet of Things and Machine Lerning in order to identify the ancient book and categorize it. This project will also allow to many young students to put in practice the studies within the “Scuola di Alta Formazione in Storia e Filologia del manoscritto e del libro antico”, formally started in the year 2018.

In such environments, human activity significantly impacts AQ, prompting increased efforts to monitor it using a range of devices. Traditional Air Quality monitoring relies on regulated stations, which are often scarce due to high costs, leaving many areas unmonitored. Low-cost sensors offer a promising solution by enabling the higher-spatial-resolution monitoring of pollution levels. In this article, we present the results of a case study conducted in an urban setting where AQ is affected by human activity, particularly during Las Fallas, Valencia’s most renowned festival, which has been declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The festival features widespread bonfires, firecrackers and large crowds, all of which contribute to worsening air pollution. In this context, we evaluate the performance of the off-the-shelf, low-cost ZPHS01B multisensor module in a real deployment. This module is capable of monitoring Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (RH), Particulate Matter (PM), CO, CO2, NO2, O3, CH2O and Volatile Organic Compounds. We analyze the features and properties of these sensors. In our deployments, the ZPHS01B module is connected to an ESP32 microcontroller and assembled into an AQ Internet of Things (IoT) node. We present AQ monitoring results from the festival and compare the measurements with those from regulated AQ monitoring stations, used as a reference. Additionally, we evaluate the power consumption of this AQ IoT node, providing its electrical operating characteristics and considering the use of duty cycles to reduce consumption while maintaining sensor stability. We conclude that this module offers promising capabilities for identifying pollution risk zones and opens the door to new research opportunities, particularly in efficient sensor calibration and AQ parameter prediction.","2025","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-06 20:06:50","","","","","","","Electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lezha region is one of these Albanian attractions, among others, famous for the Shengjinbeach. Visiting it in summer is a real challenge, because of traffic congestion caused by insufficient road infrastructure, influx of visitors, lack of signaling, etc(Ora News, 2022). As long as, this concentration of tourism during the summer is associated with many natural, economic and social consequences, the issue of infrastructure should be addressed and improved. The improvement of physical infrastructure is an important and valuable tool related to the development of tourism(Lee et al, 2020). The chosen area for intervention is the segment from Shengjin to the main intersection at the entrance, which is considered also as ‘point of death’. Nowadays, technology facilitates our lives in many directions(Javaid et al, 2018), thanks to its unlimited components and it can be applied as well in road infrastructure.This paper aims to achieve these goals by using internet of things technology and different types of sensors based on it (speed sensors, IP CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, digital signage, etc). Applying technology in this segment, provides an enhancement of Shengjin accessibility and developing more sustainable tourism in this area, contributing also to the reduction of accidents. In this way, we increase the efficiency of existing roads and improve their maintenance. Despite suggesting other mobility alternatives our proposal will convert the existing infrastructure into a better one, providing in this way a higher quality of tourism in this area and encouraging visitors to access Shengjin more often.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-05 19:32:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on the use of smart technology elements at the Rundale Palace Museum were obtained in two ways: from public reports on the museum in 2016–2021 and additionally an expert interview was conducted with the deputy director of the museum. The expert interview questions were semi-structured.FindingsThe characteristics of cultural tourism indicate the use of ICT in destination management, marketing, planning, process organization and changes in organizational culture. The recognizable elements of smart cultural tourism are the smart travel destination, smart experiences and smart business. 4.0 G technologies are required to ensure the functioning of the elements: artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the Internet of things, blockchain, cloud computing, virtual and augmented reality. Smart cultural tourism is a unified system involving several levels of national and municipal institutions, organizations, entrepreneurs and NGOs. The implementation of smart cultural tourism requires centralized funding to implement and manage digital connectivity between the stakeholders. In the Latvian and Baltic context, the Rundale Palace Museum has been established as a cultural tourism object – a Renaissance palace museum, which is the second most visited museum in Latvia. The Rundale Palace Museum digitizes the services it provides within its financial possibilities, e.g. cloud data for remote purchase of visitor tickets, self-registration of visitors in the single visitor system, augmented reality and mobile applications. The Internet of things is not used, while artificial intelligence is partially used by the museum. At the Rundale Palace Museum as a smart tourist destination, the research did not identify the following features: a technological platform, a smart destination strategy and use of big data. Further, public-private consumer cooperation is not in place. The Rundale Palace Museum was not identified as an element of smart business, as a single smart business ecosystem for cultural tourism has not been created in the entirety of Latvia as yet nor in the Zemgale region in particular. Communication between cooperation partners occurred via telephone.Originality/valueFew research studies on digital solutions for cultural tourism in Latvia and in the region of Zemgale, where the largest Renaissance pearl in Latvia and the Baltic States – the Rundale Palace Museum – is located, have been conducted; hence, this study contributes to addressing the research gap.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-05 19:36:16","","","","","","","Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the deep fragmentation of services and technologies adopted in tourism context characterizes the whole information provided also by customer sensing and IoTs (Internet of Things) heterogeneity and deep clashes with an effective organization of smart tourism. This article presents APERTO5.0 (an Architecture for Personalization and Elaboration of services and data to Reshape Tourism Offers 5.0), an innovative architecture aiming at a whole integration and deep facilitation of tourism service and information organization and blending, to enable the re-provisioning of novel services as advanced aggregates or re-elaborated ones. The proposed solution will demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of Smart Tourism by choosing the real use case of the “Francigena way” (a pilgrim historical path), the Italian part.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-05 01:36:16","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper studies and analyzes the sustainable development of heritage tourism boosted by smart tourism based on big data artificial intelligence. This paper first analyzes big data and then introduces the concept of smart tourism. Smart tourism is a new future-oriented tourism form that serves the public, enterprises, and governments. It uses the Internet of Things, cloud computing, next-generation communication network, high-performance information processing, intelligent data mining, and other technologies in tourism experience, industrial development, administrative management, and other applications, so that tourism physical resources and information resources have been highly systematically integrated and deeply developed and activated. And then, we analyze and discuss artificial intelligence algorithms. Artificial intelligence is a new technological science that is researched and developed on the basis of computer science as a simulation and extension of human intelligence activities. Finally, a comprehensive analysis is made on the tourism ecological footprint of natural heritage sites and the carrying capacity of tourism ecology in natural heritage sites. The experimental results of this paper show that the tourism development of this natural heritage site is in a sustainable state. The reasons are as follows: First, the average tourist ecological footprint of the place is 0.009466 hm2, the average tourism ecological carrying capacity is 0.032861 hm2, and there is an average ecological surplus of 0.02339 hm2; secondly, the average tourist natural footprint is 18285.93 hm2, the average tourism environmental carrying capacity is 40421.97 hm2, and the average ecological surplus is 22136.04 hm2. To sum up, it shows that its tourism development is in a state of sustainable development.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-17 18:27:25","","","","","2022","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","WOS:000826782100001","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\RFWND3V9\Dan Li et al. - 2022 - Artificial Intelligence-Based Sustainable Development of Smart Heritage Tourism.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the influence of their structure, porcelain insulators are prone to mechanical damage and cracks, which will reduce their insulation performance. After a long-term operation, crack expansion will eventually lead to breakdown and safety hazards. Therefore, it is of great significance to detect insulator cracks to ensure the safe and reliable operation of a power grid. However, most traditional methods of insulator crack detection involve offline detection or contact measurement, which is not conducive to the online monitoring of equipment. Hyperspectral imaging technology is a noncontact detection technology containing three-dimensional (3D) spatial spectral information, whereby the data provide more information and the measuring method has a higher safety than electric detection methods. Therefore, a model of positioning and state classification of porcelain insulators based on hyperspectral technology is proposed. In this model, image data were used to extract edges to locate cracks, and spectral information was used to classify the surface states of porcelain insulators with EfficientNet. Lastly, crack extraction was realized, and the recognition accuracy of cracks and normal states was 96.9%. Through an analysis of the results, it is proven that the crack detection method of a porcelain insulator based on hyperspectral technology is an effective non-contact online monitoring approach, which has broad application prospects in the era of the Internet of Things with the rapid development of electric power.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-05 19:38:49","","","","","","","Entropy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The National Science and Technology Museum cooperated with the university and the vocational high school to deliver the smart industry knowledge to senior high school students. Here, this research presented a 5-step design procedure to systematically develop an integrated teaching module for various issues. It is a demonstration example that the research generated an integrated teaching module for the smart industry’s issues by the design procedure. The knowledge database of module content was built and applied multiple teaching ways to enhance students’ attention. The module developed an e-book, one augmented reality (AR) game, one board game, and one package of teaching aids for maker education to introduce the historical developments of industrial revolutions, the internet of things, the smart vehicles, and the industrial robots. Furthermore, the learning outcome and the generic learning outcomes (GLOs) are the evaluation index and the evaluation method, respectively. By the framework of the GLOs, the questionnaire with a 5-level Likert scaling was designed for evaluating the module. By the experiment of demonstration teaching, the statistical analysis revealed that either students from the engineering or non-engineering departments have positive learning outcomes. A slight difference is in the category of “Activity, Behavior, and Progression”. The research inferred that the culture of the tested school and the students’ background could affect the learning outcomes. The result indicated that the integrated module is useful to science popularization learning of technological issues.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-06 20:00:09","","","","","","","International Journal of Information and Education Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article discusses advantages of using a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for organising and systematising research in an interdisciplinary analytical laboratory. LIMS solutions are proven to be effective in managing laboratories, organising their daily management tasks, improving work conditions and increasing productivity, managing equipment and resources, and managing and safeguarding scientific data. LIMS software is commercially available since the 1990s with over a hundred software packages intended either for general or specific purposes. However, the ones currently available do not fulfil all the requirements for heritage science or are over-the-top, complex, one-fits-all standard solutions. The system here proposed was developed for a heritage science laboratory, considering its unique requirements, having as a case study the HERCULES Lab, from the University of Évora (Portugal). This article documents our approach based on the analysis of the unique requirements for the lab resulting in a proposal of a custom user-centred web-based system. For this, we discuss in detail the workflow, and the required system architecture. We conclude that although it is a small niche market for major manufacturers to dwell on, a custom LIMS is of the utmost importance for the current management of heritage science laboratories across the globe.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-05 01:25:32","","","","","","","Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the said transformation to be carried out more sustainably and to contribute to cultural tourism, both the knowledge and opinions of those working in the field of tourism and the expectations of the tourists visiting the island are important. In this context, data were collected from both sides through the questions prepared by the researchers. In the collection of data, a semi-structured interview form consisting of nine open-ended questions for tourism professionals and seven open-ended questions for tourists visiting the island was used, four of which were common. The opinions of two experts were taken in the preparation of the interview form, which was created using the existing literature. In the analysis of the obtained data, descriptive analysis was used, while descriptive statistics were employed to quantify the collected data. Based on the research findings, it was concluded that there are important deficiencies in terms of technology, internet, and management when transferring cultural elements to digital media in Northern Cyprus and that the technological infrastructure should be developed first. In addition to the development of technology, organization, planning, and forming legal regulations at the ministerial level is also important.

This abstract provides a look into the profound potential of regenerative manufacturing, showcasing its main principles, processes, and its transformational impact on the future of design and production. Regenerative manufacturing signifies a fundamental transformation in the conceptualization, production, and use of items. The manufacturing process incorporates sustainability, circularity, and resilience throughout all its stages, encompassing material selection, design, production, distribution, and end-of-life concerns. The holistic approach discussed here places significant emphasis on the reduction of waste, optimisation of energy usage, and the utilisation of regenerative resources. This strategy aims to establish a regenerative cycle that actively supports the nourishment of the environment, rather than causing its depletion By employing novel methodologies such as biomimicry and generative design, this approach effectively harnesses the knowledge inherent in nature to stimulate the development of sustainable solutions. The regenerative manufacturing paradigm places significant emphasis on the core principles of collaboration and inclusivity. The recognition of the interconnection of all stakeholders is evident, encompassing producers, designers, customers, and local communities. By promoting openness and upholding ethical standards, this approach facilitates socially responsible production techniques that enhance the agency of local economies, safeguard cultural heritage, and prioritise the welfare of employees. The revolutionary capacity of regenerative manufacturing extends beyond the scope of specific goods and sectors. The power of this phenomenon lies in its ability to transform economic systems, facilitating a shift away from a linear model characterised by the processes of extraction, production, and disposal, towards a regenerative and circular economy. This transition offers not alone ecological advantages, but also financial robustness and enduring success.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:41","2025-07-05 19:36:20","","","","","","","E3s Web of Conferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work aims to introduce the European standard EN 15757:2010 as a potential tool for implementing effective museum PC, and it details the potential contributions of both active environmental control and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in this regard. An application of this strategy is proposed by means of a case study of the conservation of two historical violins, part of a small but significant museum collection in the City of Genoa dedicated to Paganini, whose value is inestimable. According to the standard, monitoring of environmental parameters was carried out for more than four years in the Paganini Hall of Palazzo Doria-Tursi Museum. A remote-control system was implemented, installing digital sensors in the room and in the two showcases. The data were continuously collected through an integrated platform for supervision, monitoring and shared management, based on web-cloud-IoT technology. The analysis of climate data and the assessment of the “historic climate” led to the installation of an active control system on the display cases of the “Cannone” violin and its historical copy. The intervention resulted in a cost-effective improvement in the conservation conditions of the two objects, with an efficient system of warning and safety alarms and a protocol of resolution actions still active and ongoing. The application of IoT systems in monitoring and controlling the indoor climate of heritage collections facilitated the care of the objects at a cost reduction for the institution.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:41","2025-07-17 18:31:08","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\FIZZWHIB\M.

Buckley","A Smart Archive Box for Museum Artifact Monitoring Using Battery-Less Temperature and Humidity Sensing","Sensors","","1424-8220","10.3390/s21144903","","For the first time, this paper reports a smart museum archive box that features a fully integrated wireless powered temperature and humidity sensor. The smart archive box has been specifically developed for microclimate environmental monitoring of stored museum artifacts in cultural heritage applications. The developed sensor does not require a battery and is wirelessly powered using Near Field Communications (NFC). The proposed solution enables a convenient means for wireless sensing with the operator by simply placing a standard smartphone in close proximity to the cardboard archive box. Wireless sensing capability has the advantage of enabling long-term environmental monitoring of the contents of the archive box without having to move and open the box for reading or battery replacement. This contributes to a sustainable preventive conservation strategy and avoids the risk of exposing the contents to the external environment, which may result in degradation of the stored artifacts. In this work, a low-cost and fully integrated NFC sensor has been successfully developed and demonstrated. The developed sensor is capable of wirelessly measuring temperature and relative humidity with a mean error of 0.37 °C and ±0.35%, respectively. The design has also been optimized for low power operation with a measured peak DC power consumption of 900 μW while yielding a 4.5 cm wireless communication range. The power consumption of the NFC sensor is one of the lowest found in the literature. To the author’s knowledge, the NFC sensor proposed in this paper is the first reporting of a smart archive box that is wirelessly powered and uniquely integrated within a cardboard archive box.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:41","2025-07-17 18:26:45","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\BZW6QQL9\Dinesh R.

Tourism activities extend to the various services, products, and experiences provided in the tourism site’s surrounding area. Tourism development requires information on possible related activities with tourism. However, there was a lack of studies that examined the relationship between tourism sites and the simultaneous presence of multiple public facilities, which would reveal the value of proximity. This paper aims to investigate the proximity patterns of tourism sites and the support facilities, to develop a strategy for tourism sites. The average nearest-neighbor results verify that there are clustering tendencies for almost all datasets. The Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)-based raster’s were created to visualize the patterns of tourism sites and nearby public facilities, which located near three world cultural heritage sites in Indonesia. Co-location pattern mining was applied to examine the co-location behavior between tourism sites and tourism support facilities using the Participation Index (PI) as the measurement parameter. This study provides knowledge, specifically the existence of co-location rules between tourism sites and tourism support facilities, which consist of food services, accommodations, transportation, shopping, and other tourism support facilities. The network graph shows that the location of tourism support facilities can be affected by the types of tourism sites, providing practical implications for individuals, business owners, and policymakers. Government policies related to planning for tourism destination development that consider the characteristics of spatial interactions are expected to be able to support government targets for increasing lengths of stay and tourist expenditures.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:41","2025-07-05 19:30:22","","","","","","","International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering and Information Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the uncertainty of weather and climate as well as flood events, minimal predictive information on flooding, and the lack of availability of data on the causes of flooding, a comparison of synthetic data generation from the minimal data available from BMKG with synthetic data generation from Kaggle online platform data in the form of temperature and humidity data, rainfall, and wind speed from BMKG and annual rain data from Kaggle was analyzed. This research aims to obtain the results of data comparison analysis of synthetic data generation from different datasets with the benchmark of classification system results using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and accuracy evaluation with Confusion Matrix. The research process uses climate data from the BMKG DI Yogyakarta Climatology Station within 20 months, the Geophysical Station within 12 months, and Kerala data with a range of 1901-2018. Synthetic data generation is done using the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) model. CTGAN produces quite good data in terms of distribution and data differences if the original data is large and the synthetic data generated is small. The KNN classification system on the BMKG data experienced overfitting, as indicated by the accuracy value in the evaluation increasing in the range of 85-94% and the validation decreasing in the range of 89%-65%. This is because there is no uniqueness in the data and too little original data made into synthetics, which affects the difficulty of the classification system in identifying data that is quite different in distance and data values generated by CTGAN. In Kerala, the accuracy value on evaluation is in the range of 92-95%, and validation is in the range of 0.7-0.83%, with Classifier k1 being the most optimal system.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:41","2025-07-05 18:59:33","","","","","","","International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The improvement may be in terms of preservation, revitalization, livability, and sustainability of a community. The resources of the nodes and devices in the SCC have certain constraints that may not allow the devices and nodes to cooperate to save their resources such as memory, energy, and buffer, or simply maximize their performance. Thus, to stimulate the nodes to avoid selfish behavior, SSC needs a novel and well-organized solution to motivate nodes for cooperation. This article aims to resolve the issue of selfish behaviors in SCC and to encourage the nodes for cooperation. A novel mechanism, socially omitting selfishness (SOS), has been proposed to manage/eradicate selfishness using a socially oriented election process. The election process elects different heads based on weight and cooperation (using Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves model). The election of heads and incentive mechanism encourages the nodes to show participation and behave as highly cooperative members of the community. Furthermore, an extended version of the Dempster Shafer model has been used to discourage the selfish behavior of the participating nodes in the SOS scheme. It uses different monitoring and gateway nodes to efficiently employ the proposed scheme. A mathematical model has been developed for the aforementioned aspects and simulated through NS2 simulation environment to analyze the performance of SOS. The results of the proposed scheme outperform the contemporary schemes in terms of average delivery delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average energy.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:42","2025-07-05 19:30:44","","","","","","","International Journal of Communication Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far the digital revolution has improved virtually all areas of activity within cities, such as communication, transportation, distribution, healthcare, finance, education, and business. On a similar note, it is high time for culture to follow the same trend in order for citizens to benefit from improved cultural accessibility and inclusion. Without the latter, the cultural experience would be less accessible and/or more costly. First, we showcase local initiatives regarding cultural technology. We then analyze the main initiatives in terms of public policy aimed at improving accessibility and inclusion for memory institutions (galleries, libraries, archives and museums), as well as their implications.

Information systems have increased the number of tourists visiting The Gambia by promoting the country, providing information about its attractions and amenities, and making it easier to plan and book trips. This has enabled potential tourists to make well-informed decisions. The study uses the qualitative method with a review of the literature and primary data.  According to the study, the functionality of information systems applications offers users data about hotels, travel information, and the allure of recreational products. The Gambia Tourism Authority (GTA) was established in 1982 to promote the Gambia as a tourist destination. It worked with tour operators to create holiday packages and relied on advertising and public relations to promote the Gambia. It participated in international travel fairs and exhibitions to showcase its attractions and culture and engaged in press releases and familiarization trips for travel writers. The Gambia's tourism industry has expanded its marketing efforts with information systems to include digital channels, such as internet websites and social media platforms, to promote the Gambia's natural beauty, cultural heritage, and hospitality. Personalization, localization, user-generated content, and integration can be used to attract tourists to the Gambia. Also, the information system aids in maintaining outstanding client contacts, fostering positive relationships, and ensuring longevity because of the new value chain. The global tourism industry has a complicated value chain, with IBTOs, OBTOs, and travel agencies responsible for overseeing how tourists interact with and experience each tourist site.

Low energy consumption is essential to enable battery-powered IoT nodes with a long autonomy. This paper explains the challenges posed by combining low-power and long-range connectivity. An energy breakdown demonstrates the dominance of transmit and sleep energy. The principles for achieving both low-power and wide-area are outlined, and the landscape of available networking technologies that are suited to connect remote IoT nodes is sketched. The typical anatomy of such a node is presented, and the subsystems are zoomed into. The art of designing remote IoT devices requires an application-oriented approach, where a meticulous design and smart operation are essential to grant a long battery life. In particular we demonstrate the importance of strategies such as “think before you talk” and “race to sleep”. As maintenance of IoT nodes is often cumbersome due to being deployed at hard to reach places, extending the battery life of these devices is critical.

It is used now as a valuable cultural heritage that has been experienced for a thousand years. The passing text must have its irreplaceable advantages and charm. People are extremely sensitive to visual symbols, and it is also the first step in which people can know things. Most of the books in today’s market focus on pictures and colors, which ignores the design of the text. This makes the text boring taste, causing the reader’s visual fatigue, which is not conducive to readers absorbing information through books. Therefore, this paper studies the font design in the design of the visual algorithm based on the genetic algorithm, and the font design is analyzed by the particle swarming algorithm, the decision MIMO-SCMA system of the genetic algorithm. It aims to address the dryness of today’s texts by constructing texts that are instantly recognizable and visually appealing to readers. Through innovative visual concepts, readers can enjoy the process of acquiring knowledge. In this paper, to investigate the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in font design, the number of experimental research subjects was set to 300, and 280 valid questionnaires were collected to investigate the satisfaction of users with the newly designed fonts. Experiments showed that the visual communication design based on a genetic algorithm has increased by 6.52% for the design satisfaction and the number of fonts that use the system is also increasing.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:43","2025-07-06 19:54:26","","","","","","","Emergency Medicine International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RETRATADO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Context-awareness addresses the production of large volumes of context by analyzing raw data and adding a meaning to them. Middleware systems have emerged, which perform context modelling and reasoning, supporting context-aware applications. The services provided by such applications can be personalized, automated and adapted to the current situation, thus enhancing the user interaction with the devices and the digital environment. In this work, a context-aware middleware system is presented, based on a hybrid reasoning schema, which combines multiple techniques to efficiently address each problem. The proposed middleware system is evaluated in a cultural space, where scenarios were designed and tested, using a mixture of real and artificial data.

The tourism industry suffered immensely from the lockdown, and as a result of this, digital tourism began gaining traction and attracted public attention. This study analyses the impact of digitalization on the social and economic sustainability of the tourism industry via systematic literature network analysis. The findings indicated that digitalization impacts economic sustainability, encompassing economic benefits in tourism product development, tourism consumption, and industrial development. Moreover, digitalization fosters social development, cultural awareness, and tourism participation in digital technology and cultural heritage. This study identified publication trends and research hotspots using bibliometric analysis, and it was confirmed that Sustainability was the top journal in published digital and tourism sustainability-related articles, followed by the International Journal of Tourism Research, Tourism Management, and Current Issues in Tourism. This study resulted in two implications: identifying the knowledge gap and evidence-based decision-making based on the (previous) literature. Recommendation for future research is also discussed in this study, which is helpful to policymakers, tourism planners, and researchers to develop strategies grounded in research.","2023","2025-07-05 00:14:51","2025-07-17 18:26:51","","","","","","","Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\YUBQXKBM\Chunyu Jiang e Seuk Wai Phoong - 2023 - A Ten-Year Review Analysis of the Impact of Digitization on Tourism Development (2012–2022).pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While global and regional datasets are widely used for some purposes, data are regularly acquired specifically for archaeological projects because of the very high spatial resolution required for feature detection and assessments of archaeological significance and the need for data on subsurface features. The sensing data collected for archaeology cover limited areas and only a few types of sensors, known to produce data efficiently, are regularly employed. Precision agriculture is beginning to produce large quantities of varied sensing data across extensive landscape areas. This situation creates an opportunity to adapt and reuse precision agricultural data for archaeology and heritage work, extending covering and enhancing our understanding of archaeology in contemporary agricultural landscapes. Equally, there is potential for coordinated data collection, collecting data once for multiple applications, and to add value through analyses which bring together perspectives from multiple related domains to model long-term processes in anthropogenic soil systems. This article provides a high-level overview of policy and technological developments which create the potential for sensing data reuse, coordinated data collection, and collaborative analyses across archaeological, agricultural, and agri-environmental applications while underscoring the structural barriers which, at present, constrain this potential.

After the pandemic, mixed visits, in the opinion of many experts, would become the new norm for experiencing cultural content. Diverse types of mergers between online and onsite visits have already begun to be investigated by researchers, with the purpose of not only avoiding the spread of disease but also of enabling visits of people who were previously excluded, such as persons in remote geographic areas or people with mobility challenges. In fact, over the last three years, there have been rapid developments in mixed visits in cultural heritage sites. The current work takes into account a contextual model of museum learning to define potential use scenarios for visits from people of different cultural backgrounds and offers an evaluation of current practices. The new model that emerges, the contextual model of mixed visits, allows for the further study of the field, as it attempts to describe recent research efforts in four main contexts: mixed visits in the personal context, mixed visits in the socio-cultural context, mixed visits in the physical context, and temporality of mixed visits.

This paper proposes an integrated conceptualisation for improving these two aspects, involving four technological components. First, the adoption and parameterisation of four ontologies for the digital documentation and presentation of exhibits and their conservation methods, spatial management, and evaluation. Second, a tool for capturing visitor movement in near real-time, both anonymously (default) and eponymously (upon visitor consent). Third, a mobile application delivers personalised content to eponymous visitors based on static (e.g., demographic) and dynamic (e.g., visitor movement) data. Lastly, a platform assists museum administrators in managing visitor statistics and evaluating exhibits, collections, and routes based on visitors’ behaviour and interactions. Preliminary results from a pilot implementation of this holistic approach in a multi-space high-traffic museum (MELTOPENLAB project) indicate that a cost-efficient, fully functional solution is feasible, and achieving an optimal trade-off between technical performance and cost efficiency is possible for museum administrators seeking unfragmented approaches that add value to their cultural heritage organisations.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:43","2025-07-17 18:26:33","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\2AYH2R6W\Panos Philippopoulos et al. - 2024 - A Holistic Approach for Enhancing Museum Performance and Visitor Experience.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, the fruition of complex geospatial datasets (point clouds, Building Information Modelling (BIM) models, 2D and 3D models) on the web is still a challenge, because usually it involves the usage of different proprietary software solutions, and the input data need further simplification for computational effort reduction. Moreover, integrating geospatial datasets acquired in different ways with various sensors remains a challenge. An interesting question, in that respect, is how to integrate 3D information in a 3D GIS (Geographic Information System) environment and manage different scales of information in the same application. Integrating a multiscale level of information is currently the first step when it comes to digital twinning. It is needed to properly manage complex urban datasets in digital twins related to the management of the buildings (cadastral management, prevention of natural and anthropogenic hazards, structure monitoring, etc.). Therefore, the current research shows the development of a freely accessible 3D Web navigation model based on open-source technology that allows the visualization of heterogeneous complex geospatial datasets in the same virtual environment. This solution employs JavaScript libraries based on WebGL technology. The model is accessible through web browsers and does not need software installation from the user side. The case study is the new building of the University of Twente—Faculty of Geo-Information (ITC), located in Enschede (the Netherlands). The developed solution allows switching between heterogeneous datasets (point clouds, BIM, 2D and 3D models) at different scales and visualization (indoor first-person navigation, outdoor navigation, urban navigation). This solution could be employed by governmental stakeholders or the private sector to remotely visualize complex datasets on the web in a unique visualization, and take decisions only based on open-source solutions. Furthermore, this system can incorporate underground data or real-time sensor data from the IoT (Internet of Things) for digital twinning tasks.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:43","2025-07-05 19:18:44","","","","","","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome this limitation (especially when using low-cost XR equipments, such as cardboards worn by the end user), it is possible to exploit the potentialities offered by Internet of Things (IoT) nodes with sensing/actuating capabilities. In this paper, we rely on ultrasonic sensor-based IoT systems to perceive the surrounding environment and to provide “side information” to XR systems, then performing a preliminary experimental characterization campaign with different ultrasonic IoT system configurations worn by the end user.

Serious games generate engagement, they are meaningful, entertaining, and immersive. However, when the game represents a complex system, it contains a great number of variables and the relationship between its decision components are not entirely clear. Consequently, it is necessary to offer a set of tools that increase the data visualization of the players and help in the decision-making process must be provided. In our university, logistics professors have designed a simulator for logistics decision making. On the one hand, the game has gained acceptance from the student community, but on the other hand, several students do not accomplish a satisfactory performance. Therefore, these students fail to notice lots of variable interrelationships in the game, and they do not develop the skill required to follow a good decision-making process. The goal is two folded. On the one hand, the improvement of the participant's comprehension of a complex logistical system must be reached. On the other hand, the clarity on the decision-making process has to be laid out.  A set of visualization support tools were created to accomplish those objectives. Neither of the tools aim to influence the decision-making process nor to show decision alternatives to the participant, but to highlight a few key performance indicators, constraints, and data that the students can use when making the decisions. In this paper it is presented how the participants have improved their understanding about the logistic system represented in the game, when the support tools are used. Moreover, their motivation has increased, they are more involved and committed to learn. Overall, their decision-making strategies have been modified and they have shown a better comprehension of the game structure. This paper contributes to underline the importance of visualization in student's learning, considering that currently big data, industry 4.0, as well as internet of things have gained a significant relevance in our everyday life. The design of strategic games involving these new variables are necessary.

While the concept is primarily geared towards rethinking urban morphologies, it can be furthered via the adoption of Smart Cities network technologies to provide tailored pathways to respond to contextualised challenges through the advent of data mining and processing to better inform urban decision-making processes. We argue that the ‘15-minute city’ concept can value-add from Smart City network technologies in particular through Digital Twins, Internet of Things (IoT), and 6G. The data gathered by these technologies, and processed via Machine Learning techniques, can unveil new patterns to understand the characteristics of urban fabrics. Collectively, those dimensions, unpacked to support the ‘15-minute city’ concept, can provide new opportunities to redefine agendas to better respond to economic and societal needs as well as align more closely with environmental commitments, including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This perspective paper presents new sets of opportunities for cities arguing that these new connectivities should be explored now so that appropriate protocols can be devised and so that urban agendas can be recalibrated to prepare for upcoming technology advances, opening new pathways for urban regeneration and resilience crafting.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:44","2025-07-17 18:31:52","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\YR7N6LTM\Zaheer Allam et al. - 2022 - Unpacking the ‘15-Minute City’ via 6G, IoT, and Digital Twins Towards a New Narrative for Increasin.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last decades, its strategic relevance for local economic development has led to prioritize tourism-oriented promotion objectives. Therefore, new light has been thrown on once unknown resources that have thus received the attention of tourists interested in new visit experiences. To this end, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have delivered a crucial support mainly in terms of public attraction and creation of new cultural offers. However, new urgent challenges now face tangible heritage, whose physical existence is jeopardized through extreme events and poor maintenance. Unexpected intense visit flows represent in themselves a further threat for sensitive heritages. ICTs have then to cope with more complex conservation tasks and the Internet of Things (IoT) can facilitate appropriate solutions. The paper presents a smart sensor-based infrastructure for the structural monitoring of S. Domenico Church in Matera, an emblematic city for the concerns described, which also highlighted the need for a wider conservation concept also embracing context and fruition issues. The article introduces the case study and its delicate environment, and the technological background of heritage monitoring solutions; the proposed IoT infrastructure is then described, discussing its potentialities and IoT contribution to creating more holistic and multiscale perspectives to heritage conservation.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:44","2025-07-17 18:27:02","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\VZFGU8XD\Antonella Lerario e Antonietta Varasano - 2020 - An IoT Smart Infrastructure for S.

The research methodology used is normative juridical, which examines the implementation of positive legal provisions in business law. The data used includes primary and secondary sources, obtained from legal products related to business and trade. The rapid globalization brought by the 21st century industrial revolution has resulted in significant changes in various aspects of law, politics, economics, technology, and culture. As the Industrial Revolution 4.0 relies heavily on telematics (telecommunications, media, and information), it is essential to adjust regulations in the field of business law to accommodate these changes. The Indonesian government must engage in legal development, legal harmonization, and legal reconstruction to update legal products in line with the global situation. This includes building a legal system that reflects Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution to adapt to the industrial era 4.0. As the development of business law in the Industrial 4.0 era must be consistent with Pancasila's values and the 1945 Constitution, it is crucial to prioritize these values in legal development.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:44","2025-07-06 19:59:54","","","","","","","Policy Law Notary and Regulatory Issues (Polri)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TUHZY966","journalArticle","2021","Christian Attiogbé; Flavio Ferrarotti; Sofian Maabout","Advances and Challenges for Model and Data Engineering","Jucs - Journal of Universal Computer Science","","0948-6968","10.3897/jucs.70972","","Following the stimulating discussions in the workshops held during the 9th International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI 2019), we proposed to edit a special issue compiling the fruitful research resulting from those discussions. This special issue on current research in model and data engineering of the Journal of Universal Computer Science is the outcome of that proposal. As such, it contains thoroughly revised and significantly extended versions of key papers discussed at MEDI 2019 workshops. The main objective of MEDI is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI provides an international platform for the pre- sentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries in 2011, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges. The following seven accepted papers nicely reflect the wide range of topics covered by MEDI conferences. In their paper &amp;ldquo;Enhancing GDPR Compliance Through Data Sensitivity and Data Hiding Tools&amp;rdquo;, Xabier Larrucea, Micha Moffie and Dan Mor consider the problem of fulfilling the rules set by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU within the framework of the reference architectural model industry 4.0 for the healthcare sector. This is challenging due to the highly sensitive data managed by this sector and the need to share this data between different national healthcare providers within the EU. The authors propose and implement a series of valuable tools to enhance security and privacy in this context as well as compliance with the GDPR. They also illustrate through a case study the use of the proposed tools for sharing health records and their integration within the reference framework. In their paper &amp;ldquo;BSO-MV: An Optimized Multiview Clustering Approach for Items Recommendation in Social Networks&amp;rdquo;, Lamia Berkani, Lylia Betit and Louiza Belarif present a new approach to improve accuracy and coverage of clustering based recommendations systems for social networks. The approach is based on improving the results of multiview clustering by combining it with a bees swarm optimization algorithm. Through extensive experimentation with two real-world datasets, they are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to significantly improve accuracy, outperforming others clustering-based approaches. In their paper &amp;ldquo;A Formal Model for Configurable Business Process with Optimal Cloud Resource Allocation&amp;rdquo;, Abderrahim Ait Wakrime, Souha Boubaker, Slim Kallel, Emna Guermazi and Walid Gaaloul propose a formal approach to analyse and verify con- figurable business process models as well as to optimize the cost of their implementation in the Cloud. The mechanism consists on transforming the problem into an equivalent Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) which is then feed to a solver. This transformation is done by means of translation rules from configurable business processes to SAT. This model formalizes the different configurable process behaviors including control-flow and cloud resource allocations, enabling the derivation of correct configuration variants. Weighted partial SAT formulae are integrated in the model in order to optimize the global cloud resource allocation cost. In their paper &amp;ldquo;Towards a Semantic Graph-based Recommender System: A Case Study of Cultural Heritage&amp;rdquo;, Sara Qassimi and El Hassan Abdelwahed present a semantic graph-based recommender system of cultural heritage places. Their approach consists on first constructing an emergent description that semantically augments the information about the places of interest and then model through graphs the semantic relationships between similar cultural heritage places and their associated tags. Note that the unsuper- vised nature of folksonomy&amp;rsquo;s tags semantically weakens the description of resources, which in turn hinders their indexing and decreases the quality of their classification and clustering. The semantic augmentation produced by the proposed method in the case study of cultural heritage places in Marrakesh city shows to be an effective tool to fight information overload and to produce better recommendations in this context. As such, the paper presents a valuable contribution that can be used to improve the quality of recommender systems in general. In their paper &amp;ldquo;Assembling the Web of Things and Microservices for the Management of Cyber-Physical Systems&amp;rdquo;, Manel Mena, Javier Criado, Luis Iribarne and Antonio Corral face the challenge of facilitating communication between the diverse devices and protocols used by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). They propose an approach based on the concept of digital dice (an abstraction of various objects). The digital dice builds on the web of things standard. It is based on microservices and capable of handling the interaction and virtualization of IoT devices. This work introduces a technique to build, transform and compose digital dices from descriptions of &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo;. A full transformation flow is presented and a case study is used to illustrate its implementation. The proposal is shown to be effective and flexible, improving the state of the art. In their paper &amp;ldquo;Model-Driven Engineering for End-Users in the Loop in Smart Ambient Systems&amp;rdquo;, Sylvie Trouilhet, Jean-Paul Arcangeli, Jean-Michel Bruel and Maroun Koussaifi present a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to involve the user in the process of constructing at run time component based applications, adapted to a situation and user needs, in the context of ambient systems. The proposed solution relies on several domain-specific languages and a transformation process, based on established MDE tools (Gemoc Studio, Eclipse Modeling Framework, EcoreTools, Sirius and Acceleo). In this context, the authors describe an innovative way of reinforcing the place of the user in the engineering loop. The authors propose an editor that allows the end user to be aware of the emerging applications resulting of this process, to understand their function&amp;nbsp;and use, and to modify them if desired. From these actions, feedback data are extracted to improve the process. In their paper &amp;ldquo;An Approach for Testing False Data Injection Attack on Data Depen- dent Industrial Devices&amp;rdquo;, Mathieu Briland and Fabrice Bouquet present a domain specific language (DSL) for generating test data for IoT devices/environments. The DSL is proposed for testing and simulating false data injection attacks (FDIA). First, the paper outlines a generic approach for FDIA and presents a list of possible sensor types and a categorization schema for data obtained from sensors. Then, the application of the DSL is illustrated using two examples; a simple one altering the data obtained from a temperature sensor and a more complex one concurrently altering the data obtained from three particle sensors. The authors show that their approach works well in the case study of the Flowbird parking meter system and discuss how it can be adapted to different application domains.

However, these devices consume a considerable amount of energy to perform their operations that has a significant impact on the environment, product cost and life of the device. Given this fact, energy-efficient solutions for smart environments have gained great attention from researchers and the industrial community. In this context, a novel fog-based multi-level energy-efficient framework for IoT-enabled smart environments has been proposed. To achieve this, the proposed framework adds additional two layers in the existing IoT-fog-cloud architecture -sensors-based energy-efficient hardware layer and policy layer, to monitor the energy consumption and to enable the energy-aware decision making. Initially, the main sources of energy consumption in an IoT-enabled smart environment are identified. Further, the energy requirements of a device to perform a specific task are estimated. Moreover, the alternative devices to perform the same task using less energy are searched out. Finally, a device or a set of devices, to process the job consuming lower energy while ensuring the job requirements, is selected. To validate the proposed framework, four case studies are considered -smart parking, smart hospital specifically ICU, smart agriculture and smart airport. Simulations are conducted using iFogsim toolkit and results show that a significant amount of energy can be conserved by employing the proposed framework.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:44","2025-07-05 01:27:55","","","","","","","Ieee Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this scenario, smart sensors might be equipped with novel low-power and long range communication technologies to realize a so-called low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). One of the most popular representative cases is the LoRaWAN (Long Range WAN) network, where nodes are based on the widespread LoRa physical layer, generally optimized to minimize energy consumption, while guaranteeing long-range coverage and low-cost deployment. Additive manufacturing is a further pillar of the IIoT paradigm, and advanced measurement capabilities may be required to monitor significant parameters during the production of artifacts, as well as to evaluate environmental indicators in the deployment site. To this end, this study addresses some specific LoRa-based smart sensors embedded within artifacts during the early stage of the production phase, as well as their behavior once they have been deployed in the final location. An experimental evaluation was carried out considering two different LoRa end-nodes, namely, the Microchip RN2483 LoRa Mote and the Tinovi PM-IO-5-SM LoRaWAN IO Module. The final goal of this research was to assess the effectiveness of the LoRa-based sensor network design, both in terms of suitability for the aforementioned application and, specifically, in terms of energy consumption and long-range operation capabilities. Energy optimization, battery life prediction, and connectivity range evaluation are key aspects in this application context, since, once the sensors are embedded into artifacts, they will no longer be accessible.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:44","2025-07-05 01:37:10","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Principal component analysis (PCA) as employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most significant predictors for the regression models. The findings indicate that in the cultural development model (Model 1), the number of recreational parks and students are significant positive predictors of GDP per capita. In the ICT infrastructure model (Model 2), ICT costs are found to have a significant positive impact on GDP per capita. Conversely, traditional connectivity indicators, such as the number of fixed telephone lines, show a low dependence on economic growth, suggesting diminishing returns on investment in these outdated forms of ICT. These results suggest that investments in cultural and ICT infrastructure are crucial for economic development.

RPA allows the automation of human activities on a computer, especially when these activities are repetitive and high in volume. RPA saves man-hours and increases the productive capacity of the processes. The application of RPA in civil engineering is still in its early stages, and there has been little work on the subject in the literature. This paper presents RPA technology, for the first time in the literature, as a long-term management, control, and auto fault correction process for a low-cost accelerometer that can be used in SHM applications. However, this process requires a significant number of man-hours to stay operational, given the architecture of its applications. With the application of an RPA implementation workflow formulated based on the Design Science Research Method (DSRM), the management and control of the data acquisition process of a low-cost accelerometer located on a structural column are automated and put into operation in this study. RPA also made it possible to automatically detect and notify users of errors in the process, restart the process, and bring the process back online every time errors occurred. In this way, an automated process was obtained that operated continually and freed up human labour.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:45","2025-07-05 19:14:27","","","","","","","Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eradicating hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 is still a key challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional stress on food production, demand, and supply chain systems; majorly impacting cereal crop producer and importer countries. Short food supply chain based on the production from local farms is less susceptible to travel and export bans and works as a smooth system in the face of these stresses. Local drone-based data solutions can provide an opportunity to address these challenges. This review aims to present a deeper understanding of how the drone-based data solutions can help to combat food insecurity caused due to the pandemic, zoonotic diseases, and other food shocks by enhancing cereal crop productivity of small-scale farming systems in low-income countries. More specifically, the review covers sensing capabilities, promising algorithms, and methods, and added-value of novel machine learning algorithms for local-scale monitoring, biomass and yield estimation, and mapping of them. Finally, we present the opportunities for linking information from citizen science, internet of things (IoT) based on low-cost sensors and drone-based information to satellite data for upscaling crop yield estimation to a larger geographical extent within the Earth Observation umbrella.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:45","2025-07-05 01:28:53","","","","","","","Drones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By employing the principles of Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) and leveraging the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, Cockpit4.0+ represents a pioneering approach to incorporating the IIoT within ecosystems for value co-creation. This facilitates competition and cooperation among firms, enhancing the operational dynamics within SME networks. Evaluated by experts in the ornamental stone sector, a significant sector of the Portuguese economy, the system demonstrated a positive functional acceptance rate of 78.9%. An experimental test was conducted following the positive preliminary functional evaluation of Cockpit4.0+, especially among more digitally advanced companies. The findings revealed that the on-time delivery performance under current best practices (CB.Ps) was 67.1%. In contrast, implementing coopetition network practices (CN.Ps) increased on-time delivery to 77.5%. These positive evaluations of Cockpit4.0+ underscore the practical applicability of S-D Logic and provide fresh insights into the dynamics of coopetition, particularly beneficial for SMEs. Despite its promising results, the real-world efficacy of IIoT systems like Cockpit4.0+ requires further empirical studies to verify these findings. Future research should focus on examining the scalability of Cockpit4.0+ and its adaptability across various sectors and enhancing its cybersecurity measures to ensure its long-term success and broader adoption.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:45","2025-07-06 20:03:27","","","","","","","Applied System Innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so, we examine the case of blockchain as one of the emerging innovative work-streams in development practices that could lead the way forward and pave the path for new developmental narratives as we all navigate the uncharted territories of the new digital age. This paper provides useful insights about the underlying dynamics underpinning the adoption of blockchain backed-solutions for sustainable development, and it showcases some of the promising use-cases being developed through trial-and-error experiments by its early adopters. The paper offers a deep dive into a burgeoning development practice in search of disrupting business-as-usual to solve increasingly complex development challenges by mainstreaming innovations such as blockchain-enabled solutions to rethink the ways in which development solutions are being delivered across the SDG spectrum. This work points to the significant potential of blockchain technology as a game changer in solving some of the most pressing issues hindering the global recovery post Covid-19 to transition towards greener and more inclusive economies. Nevertheless, we also stress that the hype-cycle behind the “let’s blockchain it” trend does not mean that blockchain-backed solutions are necessarily superior to other alternatives which might be less costly and less technical in nature. Development practitioners prototyping and implementing blockchain-based solutions for sustainable development can utilize these insights and discussions to make informed decisions in their journey to harness the disruptive potential of blockchain alone or in tandem with other emerging technologies in the new world of business as unusual.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:45","2025-07-06 20:05:45","","","","","","","Journal of Open Innovation Technology Market and Complexity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, implementing these technologies comes with certain obstacles, such as the limited availability of energy resources and processing power. Consequently, there is a need for energy-efficient and intelligent load-balancing models, particularly in healthcare, where real-time applications generate large volumes of data. This paper proposes a novel, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI)-based load balancing model that employs the Chaotic Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm (CHROA) and big data analytics (BDA) for cloud-enabled IoT environments. The CHROA technique enhances the optimization capacity of the Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm (HROA) using chaotic principles. The proposed CHROA model balances the load, optimizes available energy resources using AI techniques, and is evaluated using various metrics. Experimental results show that the CHROA model outperforms existing models. For instance, while the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Whale Defense Algorithm with Firefly Algorithm (WD-FA) techniques attain average throughputs of 58.247 Kbps, 59.957 Kbps, and 60.819 Kbps, respectively, the CHROA model achieves an average throughput of 70.122 Kbps. The proposed CHROA-based model presents an innovative approach to intelligent load balancing and energy optimization in cloud-enabled IoT environments. The results highlight its potential to address critical challenges and contribute to developing efficient and sustainable IoT/IoE solutions.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:45","2025-07-06 19:44:59","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This investigation concentrates on Chinese city marathons and compiles daily search index data from Baidu for 38 city marathons across the nation, spanning from January 1st, 2012 to May 3rd, 2022. Employing time series clustering to evaluate the data, and in conjunction with indices related to urban tourism resources and city development, we delve into the characteristics of how Chinese city marathons propel urban growth. The findings illustrate that the search index data for the 38 city marathons can be clustered into three categories, with Xi’an, Fuzhou, and Dalian emerging as the epicenters of clustering. The representative search index data for these three clusters reveal diverse characteristics of change. The search index shifts for three landmark races align generally with the changes observed in their respective cluster center races, however, variations exist among the search index changes for these iconic marathons. The degree of search index and its trending direction in city marathons emanate from the synergistic influence of the city’s political, economic, and tourism attributes, in addition to the event’s prominence. City marathons also catalyze urban development through economic stimulation, image enhancement, and infrastructure improvement. Future exploration of novel trajectories for urban development could be facilitated through harnessing the economic and tourism attributes of these events, and by orchestrating a unified series of marathons.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:45","2025-07-05 19:16:24","","","","","","","Plos One","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to identify collectively how far batik, as a creative industry in these countries has progressed since its establishment until the present 21st century. It was notable that batik craftsmanships have been mostly maintained as similar tools and techniques are persistently being used until today in both countries. Significant progress was observed in the design and stylization of the batik design with the use of digital approaches such as fractal geometry. Similar challenging problems faced by both nations were highlighted and clustered into internal and external issues. It was concluded that assimilations of Third Industrial Revolution technology (IR3.0) primarily centered on the use of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing to improve existing batik production. Emerging studies have shown the positive impact of integrating Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) technology such as augmented reality (AR) in promoting batik knowledge and transmitting batik as an intangible cultural heritage. The transmission of batik skills to the young generation has been a persistent problem. Thus, a brief framework was proposed to exemplify how IR4.0 technology can innovatively be used to transmit the batik skills via education platform.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-05 01:29:21","","","","","","","Sage Open","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, with the rapid development of smart contracts, the corresponding security vulnerability attack cases occur frequently. Existing Ethereum smart contract vulnerability detection tools based on static analysis techniques rely too much on expert rules, for this reason, this paper proposes an Ethereum smart contract vulnerability detection method SCSVM based on support vector machine technology. A representation of smart contracts is constructed based on the word-to-vector technique, the features of Ethereum smart contracts are extracted based on the support vector machine technique, and these features are combined to identify vulnerabilities. Experiments on Smartbugs and Smartbugs-wild show that SCSVM is significantly effective. It achieves a detection accuracy of 87.51%, outperforming five typical static analysis vulnerability detection tools in terms of F1-score. To alleviate the problems of deep learning methods over-relying on large-scale data to train models and collecting a large number of smart contract attack samples in a short period, this paper proposes a basic learner-meta-learner framework, SCLMF. solc-based acquisition of the bytecode of Ethereum smart contract Solidity, on which smart contract representations are constructed via Python and the use of SCLMF for vulnerability detection. The experiments on WScrawlD show that SCLMF has a certain detection effect. Also, to further verify the effectiveness of SCLMF, experiments were conducted on Omniglot, and the detection accuracy was 96.7% and 98.5% under 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot conditions, respectively, which exceeded Memory-Augmented Neural Networks and CONVOLUTIONAL SIAMESE NETS.

This is due to several primary advantages that the 3D environment can offer. Building information modeling (BIM) can be used as a highly advanced system to present a desired reality in a 3D interactive environment accompanied with 3D reality captured data, such as the point cloud data. As such, these 3D environments can be employed for more advanced uses, such as virtual reality and augmented reality technologies (VR and AR). Recently, BIM has been employed in the context of heritage (known as HBIM, or Heritage Building Information Modeling) for different purposes, such as to provide as-built information with the ability to interact with the end user and uploading information (e.g., historical photographs, documents about materials, or any past restoration projects) into the BIM model. This research will focus on providing an interactive rich virtual 3D model for heritage management. This virtual environment can be employed in cultural tourism and used for the abovementioned purposes. The research project has been adopted in the case of the Zainal Historical House (Bayt Zainal) located in the Historic District of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This house is described as one of the significant historical buildings in the historic district. The key aim for selecting this case study is to bridge the gap in architectural knowledge regarding these heritage buildings and their hybrid structural systems (i.e., integration of steel or concrete with the traditional “Mangbi” stone technique).","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-17 18:31:25","","","","","","","Isprs International Journal of Geo-Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\R3LJV4FJ\Ahmad Baik - 2021 - The Use of Interactive Virtual BIM to Boost Virtual Tourism in Heritage Sites, Historic Jeddah.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research uses an iterative stepwise method: (1) framework development based on regenerating, narrowing, slowing and closing resource loop principles; (2) expert workshops to understand the usage of digital technologies in a circular built environment; (3) a literature and practice review to further populate the emerging framework with relevant digital technologies; and (4) the final mapping of digital technologies onto the framework. This study develops a novel Circular Digital Built Environment framework. It identifies and maps ten enabling digital technologies to facilitate a circular economy in the built environment. These include: (1) additive/robotic manufacturing, (2) artificial intelligence, (3) big data and analytics, (4) blockchain technology, (5) building information modelling, (6) digital platforms/marketplaces, (7) digital twins, (8) the geographical information system, (9) material passports/databanks, and (10) the internet of things. The framework provides a fruitful starting point for the novel research avenue at the intersection of circular economy, digital technology and the built environment, and gives practitioners inspiration for sustainable innovation in the sector.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-06 20:04:20","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aerial and terrestrial photo data coupled with high accuracy GPS create hyper-realistic mesh and texture models, high resolution point clouds, orthophotos, and digital elevation models (DEMs) that preserve a snapshot of history. A case study is presented of the development of a hyper-realistic 3D model that spans the complex 1.7 km2 area of the Brigham Young University campus in Provo, Utah, USA and includes over 75 significant structures. The model leverages photos obtained during the historic COVID-19 pandemic during a mandatory and rare campus closure and details a large scale modeling workflow and best practice data acquisition and processing techniques. The model utilizes 80,384 images and high accuracy GPS surveying points to create a 1.65 trillion-pixel textured structure-from-motion (SfM) model with an average ground sampling distance (GSD) near structures of 0.5 cm and maximum of 4 cm. Separate model segments (31) taken from data gathered between April and August 2020 are combined into one cohesive final model with an average absolute error of 3.3 cm and a full model absolute error of &lt;1 cm (relative accuracies from 0.25 cm to 1.03 cm). Optimized and automated UAV techniques complement the data acquisition of the large-scale model, and opportunities are explored to archive as-is building and campus information to enable historical building preservation, facility maintenance, campus planning, public outreach, 3D-printed miniatures, and the possibility of education through virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) tours.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-06 19:45:23","","","","","","","Drones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims to streamline workflows, reduce error rates, improve efficiency, and provide a more engaging experience for employees. The promise of the Industrial Metaverse to drive sustainability and resource efficiency is compelling. Using advanced technologies such as the Industrial Metaverse is vital in an endeavor to have a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving business environment. However, the environmental impact of the technologies underpinning the Industrial Metaverse, like data centers and network infrastructure, should not be overlooked. The ecological footprint of these technologies must be considered in the sustainability equation. Researchers have warned that, by 2025, without sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) practices, AI will consume more energy than the human workforce, significantly offsetting zero carbon gains. As the Metaverse persists in evolving and gaining momentum, it will be necessary for companies to prioritize sustainability and explore new ways to balance technological advancements with environmental stewardship. However, recent studies have conjectured that the Metaverse holds the potential to reduce carbon emissions, as digital replacements for physical goods become more prevalent and physical activities like mobility and construction are reduced. Moreover, the specific extent to which this substitution can alleviate environmental concerns remains an open issue, presenting a knowledge gap in understanding the real-world impact of digital replacements. Thus, the objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the Industrial Metaverse, as well as explore the environmental impact of the Industrial Metaverse. The integrative literature review design and methodological approach involved multiple sources from the Web of Science and databases such as the ACM library, IEEE Library, and Google Scholar, which were analyzed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the developments in the Industrial Metaverse. Firstly, by considering the Industrial Metaverse’s architecture, we elucidate the Industrial Metaverse concept and the associated enabling technologies. Secondly, we performed an exploration through a discussion of the prevalent use cases and the deployment of the emerging Industrial Metaverse. Thirdly, we explored the impact of the Industrial Metaverse on the environment. Lastly, we address novel security and privacy risks, as well as upcoming research challenges, keeping in mind that the Industrial Metaverse is based on a strong data fabric. The results point to the Industrial Metaverse as having both positive and negative environmental effects in terms of energy consumption, e-waste, and pollution. Research, however, indicates that most Industrial Metaverse applications have a positive environmental impact and subsequently trend toward sustainability. Finally, for sustainability in the Industrial Metaverse, enterprises may consider utilizing renewable energy sources and cloud services. Furthermore, we examined the effects of products on the environment, as well as in the creation of a circular economy.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-06 19:49:46","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scoping review procedure was followed. The six critical steps and four supporting tools of the HUL approach were used to analyze the examined papers. Most aspects of urban heritage management within the body of literature were directly related to urban-scale facility management. The potential usage of building information modelling became one of the most discussed technological aspects. The expansion of the public–private partnership model into the public–private–people partnership is considered as a new potential business model. At the same time, the adaptive reuse approach is deemed to be the most sustainable method of managing heritage areas. This scoping review identified the financial tools as the most under-researched urban heritage facility management component.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution, contexts, and design elements of AR in tourism over the period (2002–2022), offering insights for further progress in this domain. Employing a dual-method approach, a bibliometric analysis was conducted on 861 articles collected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, to investigate the evolution of AR research over time and across countries, and to identify the main contexts of the utilization of AR in tourism. In the second part of our study, a systematic content analysis was conducted, focusing on a subset of 57 selected studies that specifically employed AR systems in various tourism situations. Through this analysis, the most commonly utilized AR design components, such as tracking systems, AR devices, tourism settings, and virtual content were summarized. Furthermore, we explored how these components were integrated to enhance the overall tourism experience. The findings reveal a growing trend in research production, led by Europe and Asia. Key contexts of AR applications in tourism encompass cultural heritage, mobile AR, and smart tourism, with emerging topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and COVID-19. Frequently used AR design components comprise mobile devices, marker-less tracking systems, outdoor environments, and visual overlays. Future research could involve optimizing AR experiences for users with disabilities, supporting multicultural experiences, integrating AI with big data, fostering sustainability, and remote virtual tourism. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of AR in shaping the future of tourism in the post COVID-19 era, by providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in the tourism industry.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-06 19:53:33","","","","","","","Multimodal Technologies and Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In those cases, it is of interest to assess the potential risk of punctual changes in indoor environments that can be harmful to artworks. These conditions can be assessed by means of a microclimate monitoring system comprised of a set of energy-efficient wireless sensors connected to the cloud using IoT techniques. This approach was followed at the baroque church of Saint Thomas and Saint Philip Neri in Valencia (Spain). A set of 26 wireless nodes was installed, which recorded values of temperature and relative humidity every hour for a period of 7 months. Small differences of temperature were obtained among sensors, so that an efficient methodology based on principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for the characterization of similarities and dissimilarities between sensors. Daily ranges of temperatures were studied as well as mean trajectories, differences between days of the week, and changes in the correlation structure of daily median values over time. Results provide a framework for an efficient characterization of temperatures in heritage buildings based on a network of wireless sensors. Such a framework is useful to assess the potential risk of temperature fluctuations on the preventive conservation of historical buildings and artworks.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-06 19:42:40","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the existing methods, manually performing macro-level classification and identification of personnel in intricate spheres is tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient. The availability of several artificial intelligence models in recent times presents a new paradigm shift in object classification and tracking in complex settings. In this study, several compact and efficient deep learning model architectures are explored, and a new efficient model is constructed by fusing the learning capabilities of the individual, efficient models for better object feature learning and optimal inferencing. The proposed model ensures rapid identification of personnel in complex working environments for appropriate safety measures. The new model construct follows the contributory learning theory whereby each fussed model brings its learned features that are then combined to obtain a more accurate and rapid model using normalized quantization-aware learning. The major contribution of the work is the introduction of a normalized quantization-aware learning strategy to fuse the features learned by each of the contributing models. During the investigation, a separable convolutional driven model was constructed as a base model, and then the various efficient architectures were combined for the rapid identification and classification of the various hardhat classes used in complex industrial settings. A remarkable rapid classification and accuracy were recorded with the new resultant model.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-05 01:33:45","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to the increasingly formidable challenges faced by secondary school teachers, this study endeavors to analyze and explore the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enhance their cognitive literacy. Initially, this discourse delves into the application of AI-generated electronic images in the training and instruction of middle school educators, subjecting it to thorough analysis. Emphasis is placed on elucidating the pivotal role played by AI electronic images in elevating the proficiency of middle school teachers. Subsequently, an integrated intelligent device serves as the foundation for establishing a model that applies intelligent classification and algorithms based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO). This model is designed to assess the cognitive literacy and teaching efficacy of middle school educators, and its performance is juxtaposed with classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and decision trees. The findings reveal that, following 600 iterations of the model, the SVM algorithm achieves a 77% accuracy rate in recognizing teacher literacy, whereas the SOLO algorithm attains 80%. Concurrently, the spatial complexities of the SVM-based and SOLO-based intelligent literacy improvement models are determined to be 45 and 22, respectively. Notably, it is discerned that, with escalating iterations, the SOLO algorithm exhibits higher accuracy and reduced spatial complexity in evaluating teachers’ pedagogical literacy. Consequently, the utilization of AI methodologies proves highly efficacious in advancing electronic imaging technology and enhancing the efficacy of image recognition in educational instruction.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:46","2025-07-05 19:14:59","","","","","","","Peerj Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, a sustainable approach to landscape/heritage should also carefully describe the participatory processes in recognizing, enhancing, and sharing meaningful values for a community. Starting with the Icomos recommendations about heritage modes of representation, this paper extends the research question to landscape/heritage where there are required methodologies that take into consideration both visible and objective aspects for depicting the interactions of people and territory, and its “becoming”. This contribution will therefore outline the main forms adopted today for the visualization and communication of the landscape that can monitor human and physical processes in progress and that, while being in continuity with the idea of landscape rooted in the West on the intangible aspect of “visibility”, they also need to be increasingly performative in describing the territorial and tangible complexity of dynamics and phenomena on a large scale.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:47","2025-07-05 19:36:04","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:47","2025-07-17 18:29:33","","","","","","","Journal of Information Technology in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\866CD9H6\Min Deng et al. - 2021 - From BIM to Digital Twins A Systematic Review of the Evolution of Intelligent Building Representati.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many ways to learn, but only a few capture my interest. However, education has grown more interesting and attractive with the aid of technology. A very exciting step forward in education is merging the real and digital worlds through Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The term used to denote the digital world is the ""Metaverse."" Metaverse enables us to engage in virtual conversations with others by utilizing avatars that mirror ourselves. Using Metaverse technology, readers of certain books have discovered ways to study rather than focusing on their screens. Several advanced technologies, such as Blockchain, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), game design, Internet computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are integrated into the Metaverse, an innovative idea in social work. The integration of the Metaverse is expected to contribute significantly to the advancement of education. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge that the development of educational Metaverse concepts is still in its early stages. Addressing issues related to the Metaverse's objective in the classroom is critical. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive literature review on integrating the Metaverse in educational environments. We will start by giving a general overview of the Metaverse, its educational uses, and some background on the motivations behind its use. Moving on to the educational aspect, we examine the Metaverse, identifying its defining characteristics, including educational environments, Integrated technologies, and customized instructions. Following this, we suggested a basic structure for how teachers and students could connect in the Metaverse classroom. In addition, we investigate the most recent case studies of Metaverse in education, including investigations conducted by academic institutions and technology enterprises. Finally, this paper thoroughly analyzes the Metaverse in education, covering its current technological state, challenges, opportunities, prospects, and feature directions.

This paper, therefore, proposes using a Wi-Fi probe to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of tourists’ spatial preferences in historic districts. We conducted a one-week measurement in the Xiaohe Street Historic Block in Hangzhou, China. Three indicators—visit time preference, aggregation preference, and stay preference—were used to examine the dynamic change in tourists’ spatial preferences, with 15 min as the time unit and public spaces with a radius of 25 m as the spatial unit. Our research demonstrates that, compared with conventional big data, the Wi-Fi probe offers a more reasonable and accurate method to measure tourists’ spatial preferences in historic districts at a smaller time and spatial granularity.

The research methodology is mixed, using the symphony metaphor and conducting bibliometric analysis. The researchers interrogated the literature landscape about 4IR to outline the substantial opportunities and potential impacts. They conducted a bibliometric analysis of the contemporary academic discourse linking 4IR to metropolitan areas.

In contemporary times, there is a notable emphasis among local residents and experts on the matter of effectively integrating the historical and cultural aspects, distinctive qualities, and traditional practices of a given locality with the demands and dynamics of urban life in a manner that preserves its historical essence. The present study focuses on several questions: What are the philosophical underpinnings and conceptual significance of conservation, regeneration, and urban evolution? What are the existing guidelines and implemented schemes of regeneration in China based on the principles of Space syntax theory and configurational analysis? The primary goal is to enhance the functionality of historical conservation of towns and improve the living environment for the local inhabitants. The study begins with the challenges faced in the historical conservation of towns in the backdrop of high-speed urbanization. Subsequently, it introduces the Space syntax theory as a theoretical perspective to address the problem of how to ensure the preservation of historical towns in linewith the demands of the modern cities in China. The current study used the bibliometric analysis method based on Scopus, Dimension and Web of science databases. The analysis was performed on R software and VOS viewer. Furthermore, only published articles, review papers and book chapters were selected that are published between 2000–2022. Lastly, the study suggests that the future research on the conservation of historical cities in China shall focus on policy formulation and community involvement in conservation and the regeneration of historic areas. The need to involve the public in the decision-making process of the future of their cities is imperative, since the locals are the end-users to every regeneration scheme, hence they are the key stakeholder responsible for ensuring the sustainability of their region.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:47","2025-07-05 19:37:28","","","","","","","Frontiers in Environmental Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An aerosol generator was utilized to produce various sizes of monodispersed particulate matter (PM), which was introduced into a laboratory smoke chamber under resistance heating/cooling and/or varying RH conditions. In addition, the accuracy of the air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) sensors of the LCSs were assessed against calibrated, laboratory-grade instruments. The study LCSs showed generally accurate readings for PM2.5, irrespectively of the slow T and/or RH changes, which provided apt conditions for accurate calibration slopes (S) and low intercepts/bias (b) of the linear fits. On the other hand, PM1 and PM10 readings slightly deviated from those observed with the reference monitor, likely due to the lower detection efficacy of the LCSs towards fine and coarse PM. Varying RH influenced the S and b values, showing its impact on the detection efficacy of LCSs. Under low/medium RH, homoscedastic calibration curves of PMx were found, whereas rather heteroscedastic calibration plots were observed at high RH. For T calibration, low RH in the smoke chamber provided more reproducible conditions in terms of lower measurement bias for LCSs as recorded against a calibrated, reference-grade thermometer.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:47","2025-07-05 01:30:18","","","","","","","Atmosphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This unique research analyses the influence of building use at San Juan del Hospital, the oldest church in the city of Valencia. Its architectural characteristics and the climate of the city mean that visits to the building put the conservation of its heritage assets at risk. Monitoring data from the summer months were put into a digital twin generated from a heritage building information model (HBIM), and the modelling of visitor numbers and the impact on indoor environmental quality was conducted. Monitoring and simulations confirmed that visitor numbers need to be reduced or mechanical conditioning systems need to be installed to prevent damage to the heritage artefacts within the building.

Among these technologies, 3D laser scanning technology stands out for phenomena analysis and monitoring, with various applications being studied for construction management. This study aimed to identify structural members from point cloud data (PCD) obtained through 3D laser scanning and utilize them for the measurement of work progress in construction projects. The method for identifying members is to obtain location coordinate data from the BIM (Building Information Modeling) model of the project and identify the structural member in the PCD by comparing them with the member’s location coordinates from the PCD obtained with a 3D laser scanner. In this study, members such as columns, beams, girders, walls, and slabs among the structural members constructed at construction sites were identified through this process. For identified structural members completed at the actual construction site, the unit price and quantity were taken from the construction project’s bill of quantity (BOQ) database, and then the Earned Value (EV) was calculated. The results of the study suggest that the progress measurement process through BIM and 3D laser scanning, which was previously performed manually, can contribute to faster and more accurate work progress measurement. Ultimately, it is expected that efficient process management will be possible, contributing to the realization of sustainable construction management.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:48","2025-07-06 19:44:10","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Business Process Management (BPM) is a field among others that is affected by this new technology. To assist data and events explosion resulting, among others, from IoT, data analytic processes combined with event processing techniques, examine large data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations between collected events, either at a very technical level (incident/anomaly detection, predictive maintenance) or at business level (customer preferences, market trends, revenue opportunities) to provide improved operational efficiency, better customer service and competitive advantages over rival organizations. In order to capitalize the business value of data and events generated by IoT sensors, IoT, Data Analytics and BPM need to meet in the middle. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end IoT-BPM integration architecture (IoDEP: IoT-Data-Event-Process) for a proactive business process incident management. A case study is presented and the obtained results from our experimentations demonstrate the benefit of our approach and allowed us to confirm the efficiency of our assumptions.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:48","2025-07-06 19:46:18","","","","","","","International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the tremendous capacity of convolutional neural networks makes it difficult for them to be implemented on resource-constrained devices. Channel pruning provides a promising solution to compress networks by removing a redundant calculation. Existing pruning methods measure the importance of each filter and discard the less important ones until reaching a fixed compression target. However, the static approach limits the pruning effect. Thus, we propose a dynamic channel-pruning method that dynamically identifies and removes less important filters based on a redundancy analysis of its feature maps. Experimental results show that 77.10% of floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) and 91.72% of the parameters are reduced on VGG16BN with only a 0.54% accuracy drop. Furthermore, the compressed models were implemented on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a significant speed-up was observed.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:48","2025-07-06 19:54:34","","","","","","","Electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This structural information can be used to express and describe the Internet requirements. With the increasing demand for the Internet applications, the number of objects in the network and the complexity of the structure are also growing, so we can design suitable clustering algorithms to obtain more reasonable network structure information by using different semantic information in the heterogeneous information network. Firstly, the caching scheme is transformed into a backpack problem, and the storage scheme is obtained recursively by using dynamic programming, after which the computational task is optimized based on this storage scheme by using the whale algorithm to make it the least costly. The exact balance between the connotation essence of traditional culture and the emotional resonance in modern life has not yet been found, and the visual language belonging to cultural aesthetics under the combination of traditional and modern aesthetics needs to be explored for a long time. From an objective point of view, the digital art communication of cultural elements still suffers from five problems: lack of communication cultivation and stratification of target audiences, low quality of transcription of digital artworks, unbalanced economic and cultural values, uneven development of digital art communication forms, and low degree of Internet adaptation. A ranking algorithm based on fusing multiple meta-paths is proposed to better reflect the ranking values of different object distributions of the Internet data in heterogeneous information networks, which can obtain better clustering, while better clustering can be calculated to obtain more reasonable rankings, and finally, the types of the Internet-oriented applications are divided into multiple reasonable clusters. The effects of selecting different meta-paths on the clustering algorithm and the effects of fused meta-paths versus single meta-paths on the clustering results are given in the experimental results section. Also compared with other clustering algorithms, the I-RankClus algorithm can better achieve the data clustering classification for the Internet application scenarios.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:50","2025-07-06 19:58:29","","","","","","","Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our current article raises the issue of how can smart cities affect the creative process? We believe that creativity becomes a process linked into a digital world and becomes much more interactive. That is why new ways of artistic and digital expression can be welcomed by those who are used to new technologies, which daily influence human activity in the space of the city. In other words, with the use of the existing technology inside the cities and their interconnections with other cities we can conceive creative strategies that will contribute to preserve the memory as well as the cultural and creative identity of a people. Video-mapping is precisely one of those creative strategies, once it will directly interact between the real dimension and the virtual dimension. The use of video-mapping, as an element of covering the facades of buildings, can somehow help to make the streets more dynamic and transform them into other atmospheres. The city becomes part of the third dimension and people are interacting between the real and the virtual. The management of the urban space has been gradually changing and following the technological advance. Mobility and sustainability is one of the key factors in which a smart city has invested the most. Now is the time to invest in a relationship between the city and the people, making it more humane and giving space for creativity.","2020","2025-07-05 00:15:52","2025-07-06 19:45:53","","","","","","","Creativity Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they are currently located within the boundaries of the historical area of a big city. Postindustrial objects that have lost their initial function create opportunities for city development. An urgent problem of urban planning in Lviv is to determine the prospects for the development and reconstruction of industrial areas, complexes, and buildings. The purpose of the work is to identify the modern urban trends in the development process of postindustrial areas located in the historic area of Lviv, as well as its compliance with the city development strategy. The article investigates the connection of new objects with the main functions of the district, provides a historical excursion of their development, on-site studies, and a comparative analysis of objects with the goals of the master plan of Lviv and of the integrated concept of development of the central part of the city. The studied objects of the urban revitalization of postindustrial buildings and areas are grouped according to new dominant function: 1—Development of the creative industry; 2—Revalued multifunctional areas; 3—Implementation of the concept of city center expansion; 4—Reconstruction of historical localities, and 5—Creation of new residential complexes. The authors consider the process of re-urbanization in some particular postindustrial areas and objects as a search for ideas to generalize their use for the whole city. The intensive industrial development of the city during the Soviet period led to strict regulation of other areas. After obtaining independence, there is an opportunity to fix the imbalance. This process occurs in different ways. In particular, the “in situ” review provides an opportunity to understand the development of the territory—whether it follows the master plan (or contradicts it), whether it meets the new development strategy of the city, whether it meets the needs of the local community, or meets the interests of developers only.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:53","2025-07-05 19:38:40","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monitoring and protecting historical architectural features is an urgent issue. According to the theory of biological gene expression, genes are the fundamental units that control and express biological traits. Similarly, the “genes” of historical architecture are the basic units that control historic features. Identifying these historical architecture “genes” involves identifying the main factors that control the historic features. This process is important for monitoring and protecting the historic features. At present, qualitative subjectivity, difficult quantification, poor recognition accuracy, and low reasoning and recognition efficiency exist in the genetic identification of historic buildings. As an example, this article describes Chinese Baroque architecture in Harbin, China, and draws on the principles of biological gene recognition to reference methods of architectural gene recognition in cultural geography and architecture. Improved U-Net models, traditional U-Net models, FCN models, and EfficientNet models that incorporate channel attention mechanisms are used to identify historic building genes, obtaining the optimal intelligent recognition for historical architectural genes based on deep learning. This research shows that the accuracy of an improved U-Net model incorporating a channel attention mechanism is 69%, which is 4%, 7%, and 1% higher than those of the traditional U-Net, FCN, and EfficientNet, respectively. The F1 score of the improved U-Net model reaches 0.654, which is higher than the 0.619 of the traditional U-Net model, 0.645 of the EfficientNet model, and 0.501 of the FCN model. Therefore, the improved U-Net model is the optimal method for identifying historical architecture genes. This research can provide new tools and methods for identifying historical architectural genes.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:54","2025-07-06 19:50:49","","","","","","","Heritage Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pre- and post-tests assessed students’ problem-solving abilities across four key indicators: understanding the problem, devising a plan, executing the plan, and reflecting on the solution. Results showed significant improvements in all indicators, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in fostering essential skills.

The losses of the Ukrainian tourism economy during the war significantly exceeded the losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of tourist flows to Ukraine, the outflow of investments from the tourism sector, the high level of danger of staying in many regions of the country, the destruction of the tourist infrastructure has become key challenges. In 2022, the revenues of the State Budget of Ukraine from the tourism industry decreased sharply. The incompleteness of the administrative-territorial reform, financial insufficiency, and the unprecedented outflow of human resources with significant losses in the tourism industry actualize the scientific search for reducing the negative consequences of the current crisis. The article aims: Тo substantiate, on the concept level, effective management approaches to the economic, ecological, and social development of sustainable tourism, as one of the directions for the restoration of territorial communities in the post-war period. Methods/Approach: Using economic and statistical methods, the article provides an assessment of the country's domestic economy, which is characterised by a decrease in the volume of real gross domestic product by 11.4% in the first year of the war compared to the previous one, a reduction in real wages, and an increase in unemployment. The use of methods of analysis and synthesis made it possible to assess the damage caused to the regions of Ukraine and to identify trends in the development of territorial communities and the tourism sector. Results: The analysis of statistical reports proves that tourism and hospitality development in 2017-2020 (a pre-crisis period for the named industries) required harmony of interests between tourism business entities and local territorial communities. The hypothesis has been confirmed that sustainable development of tourism will stimulate the post-war recovery and evolution of territorial communities. A cluster-based approach to the initiation of tourism development programs is proposed with congregating territorial communities into four groups depending on the consequences of hostilities and selection of specific focus areas. A ""win-win"" strategy is suggested as a conceptual background for effective management of the territories' restoration and development based on harmonisation of interests between territorial communities and business. Conclusions:The study is relevant from the point of view of solving the problems of financing the social and economic development of territorial communities through the activation of resources and the creation of a more stable and favorable environment for sustainable tourism.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:55","2025-07-05 19:28:23","","","","","","","Access Access to Science Business Innovation in Digital Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The heart of an IoE environment is a Context-Aware System that facilitates service discovery, delivery, and adaptation based on context classification. The context has been defined in a domain-dependent way, traditionally. The classical models of context have been focused on rich context and lack Cost of Context (CoC) that can be used for decision support. The authors present a philosophy-inspired mathematical model of context that includes confidence in activity classification of context, the actions performed, and the power information. Since a single recurring activity can lead to distinct actions performed at different times, it is better to record the actions. The power information includes the power consumed in the complete context processing and is a quality attribute of the context. Power consumption is a useful metric as CoC and is suitable for power-constrained context awareness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work, example contexts are described, and the context model is presented mathematically in this study. The context is aggregated with power information, and actions and confidence on the classification outcome lead to the concept of situational context. The results show that the context gathered through sensor data and deduced through remote services can be made more rich with CoC parameters.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:56","2025-07-06 20:06:38","","","","","","","Frontiers in Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their use and the results achieved are rarely framed within the context of Digital Era Governance (DEG), an undertaking that would significantly reduce the capabilities of knowledge transfer from the academic and/or private environment to the public domain. The purpose of this study was to highlight, by a bibliometric analysis, the areas of proposed use of this team of tools and the extent to which these can enter the sphere of interest of public administrations, especially local ones. From a methodological point of view, based on the 439 articles filtered from the Web of Science database where UAS/UAV and GIS technologies were used, several bibliometric analyses have emerged. VOSviewer and R (Bibliometrix tool) were used to conduct the bibliometric analyses. Most scientific publications that used UAV technology as a working tool have predominant applicability in photogrammetry, while GIS applications are found in publications dedicated to image processing, landslides, and cultural and archaeological heritage. We point out that from the point of view of international cooperation, at the level of institutions or countries, certain international organisations from the USA, China, and the central and northern European states have a high interest in this topic, and a low cooperation between academia and public administration is exhibited. The conclusion is represented by the apparent lack of framing of the results of UAS–GIS technologies usage into wider and more topical contexts, such as digital era governance, and also a reduced applicability of the research results.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:56","2025-07-05 19:21:46","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environment in engineering is very complex, resulting in the corners or multi-line intersections being blocked and unable to be measured directly. In order to solve this problem, a prediction and optimization algorithm for intersection point of spatial multi-lines based on photogrammetry is proposed. The coordinates of points on space lines are calculated by photogrammetry algorithm. Due to the influence of image point distortion and point selection error, many lines do not strictly intersect at one point. The equations of many space lines are used to fit their initial value of intersection point. The initial intersection point is projected onto each image, and the distances between the projection point and each line on the image plane are used to weight the calculated spatial lines in combination with the information entropy. Then the intersection point coordinates are re-fitted, and the intersection point is repeatedly projected and recalculate until the error is less than the threshold value or reached the set number of iterations. Three different scenarios are selected for experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the intersection point.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:57","2025-07-05 19:38:02","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the most recent implications of the pandemic crisis warned both managers and politicians of the urgent need for new development paths aligned with sustainability, particularly with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. Furthermore, direct issues related to tourism activity, such as overtourism, pollution, and economic dependency, call for alternative and balanced approaches. Smart and digital solutions might play a key role in this process, but little is known concerning their potential. Aiming to extend knowledge concerning these potentials, a systematic literature review was conducted to examine the state-of-the-art about the implications of digital transformation in tourism as a catalyst for sustainable development, identifying gaps and providing directions for future research. From the analysis of 38 manuscripts, visitor experience, destination management, business solutions, and smart sustainable destinations emerged as the most common topics. However, inconsistencies were identified concerning the management narratives and the actual implementation of smart approaches. Additionally, the novelty of the concepts gravitating around smart tourism promotes some theoretical inconsistencies, which also need to be remedied.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:57","2025-07-06 19:56:55","","","","","","","Information Technology &Amp; Tourism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As we move into the 21st century, one of the institutional transformations is catalyzed by the emergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a techno-economic paradigm shift and the epochal creation of a new online social structure. However, there is a lack of understanding about the impact of ICT on common resource management, particularly in urban settings, that is urban commons. This study presents a systematic literature review of ICT-enabled urban commons with particular attention to its application to climate-related issues such as climate mitigation/adaptation in order to improve our collective ability to leverage ICT for building a more sustainable and resilient city. A total of 66 pieces of literature were included in our qualitative synthesis. We analyzed the geographical, categorical, and climate relevance. Subsequently, we used the coupled infrastructure system framework as a system thinking approach to dissect distinct usefulness of ICT-enabled commons in the building of relationships between resource system, resource user, infrastructure, and infrastructure provider to tackle climate-related issues. Our findings identified three key contributions of ICT to innovate climate-resilient solutions: 1) to redefine role of resource user as co-producer, co-designer, and co-monitor; 2) to enable real-time data-driven urban planning; 3) to improve resource efficiency and effectiveness. In other words, in a time of insufficient and limited public resources, the public sector can leverage the power of technology to harness public support and engage non-traditional stakeholders to make cities more sustainable and resilient while allowing policy-making to be big data-driven to tackle new urban problems that cannot be otherwise uncovered without the aid of ICT. The results provide directions to rethink the city based on collective action to diversity modes to govern common resources.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:57","2025-07-05 19:15:59","","","","","","","Environment and Planning B Urban Analytics and City Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The OCD4M algorithm is validated and analyzed with the simulated conditions of quantity, view angle, and focal length of cameras, at different monitoring distances. To demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of the algorithm, we conducted field tests and developed the mine safety monitoring prototype system which can alert people to slope collapse risks. The simulation’s experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively calculate the optimum quantity of cameras and corresponding coordinates with an accuracy of 30 cm at 500 m (for a given camera). Additionally, the field tests show that the algorithm can effectively guide the deployment of mine cameras and carry out 3D inspection tasks.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:57","2025-07-05 18:58:34","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores how building information modeling and building performance simulation technologies can be integrated into digital decision support systems (DSS) to make building data accessible and usable by non-digital expert operators through user-friendly services. The method followed to develop the digital DSS is illustrated and then demonstrated with a simulation-based application conducted on the heritage case study of the Faculty of Engineering in Bologna, Italy. The analysis allows insights into the building’s energy performance at the space and hour scale and explores its relationship with the planned occupancy through a data visualization approach. In addition, the conceptualization of the DSS within a digital twin vision lays the foundations for future extensions to other technologies and data, including, for example, live sensor measurements, occupant feedback, and forecasting algorithms.","2023","2025-07-05 00:14:51","2025-07-06 20:05:36","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

People are becoming more aware of their surroundings and the importance of minimizing the risk of exposure to potential sources of infection. This shift in mindset is particularly important in indoor environments, especially hospitals, where there is a greater risk of virus transmission. The implementation of route planning in these areas, aimed at minimizing interaction and exposure, is crucial for positively influencing individual behavior. Accurate maps of buildings help provide location-based services, prepare for emergencies, and manage infrastructural facilities. There aren’t any maps available for most installations, and there are no proven techniques to categorize features within indoor areas to provide location-based services. During a pandemic like COVID-19, the direct connection between the masses is one of the significant preventive steps. Hospitals are the main stakeholders in managing such situations. This study presents a novel method to create an adaptive 3D model of an indoor space to be used for localization and routing purposes. The proposed method infuses LiDAR-based data-driven methodology with a Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) model-driven process using game theory. The game theory determines the object localization and optimal path for COVID-19 patients in a real-time scenario using Nash equilibrium. Using the proposed method, comprehensive simulations and model experiments were done using QGIS to identify an optimized route. Dijkstra algorithm is used to determine the path assessment score after obtaining several path plans using dynamic programming. Additionally, Game theory generates path ordering based on the custom scenarios and user preference in the input path. In comparison to other approaches, the suggested way can minimize time and avoid congestion. It is demonstrated that the suggested technique satisfies the actual technical requirements in real-time. As we look forward to the post-COVID era, the tactics and insights gained during the pandemic hold significant value. The techniques used to improve indoor navigation and reduce interpersonal contact within healthcare facilities can be applied to maintain a continued emphasis on safety, hygiene, and effective space management in the long term. The use of three-dimensional (3D) modeling and optimization methodologies in the long-term planning and design of indoor spaces promotes resilience and flexibility, encouraging the adoption of sustainable and safe practices that extend beyond the current pandemic.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:58","2025-07-05 01:17:17","","","","","","","Frontiers in Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Appropriately, the development of a SV is related to a family’s participation in the motivation and access to education, the increase in knowledge of information technology, information and communications technology (ICT) literacy, and also in the creation of facilities for research and development (R&amp;D). The partnership between the public administration, the private sector, and the community heads will lead to a smart economy within the village. At the same time, the intervention of the food system to support climate change can be supported by intelligent agriculture. The SV has a strong social significance; research in the field can be multidisciplinary, including human nutrition, climate change, and community education. This paper aims to X-ray the research areas of the SV from a multidisciplinary sense, in support of the partnership with the community, and to identify the main directions of strategic development. In total, 368 pieces of research on SVs from the last ten years were analyzed through bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software, doubled by the co-occurrence of keywords and the bibliometric combination of documents, followed by a systematic review of the literature. The research undertaken was intended to contribute to the development of research for SVs, with the analysis of identified clusters. The results obtained will have a special contribution at the SV level through strategic and research proposals and suggest that the most important strategic and research directions for SVs focus on community education, its satiety, as well as several environmental and social changes generated by SVs.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:58","2025-07-05 19:39:14","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heritage attracts tourism and drives tourist income, as well as bringing wider economic, social and environmental benefits. This study aims to improve understanding of the relationship between heritage protection spending in countries and economic development via tourism revenues via economic logic and the Kuznets curve. Design/methodology/approach This study applies economic modelling to test for the presence of a Kuznets curve. This study uses rare available matched data on heritage protection spending from UNESCO and on travel and tourism total contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Findings This paper finds evidence of a negative quadratic relationship between heritage protection spending per capita and tourism GDP per capita, whereby increases in heritage spending initially lead to more tourism income (typically less developed nations), but then tourism spending increases more rapidly for smaller increases heritage spending on top of this initial investment (typically more developed nations). No countries are yet at the stage where they reap high tourism income from much lower levels of heritage spending. Research limitations/implications The findings suggest that the future of heritage tourism will be very different to that of today; future tourism is likely to develop significantly through innovations in management approach and advanced technologies to manage the balance between demand and heritage degradation. Practical implications The predictive model allows us to plot future possibilities for heritage tourism, which in turn enables more informed decision-making regarding the planning and management of future heritage resources and tourism demand. Tourism heritage institutions and their benefactors should further plan and invest in innovations (such as technologies and management practices) to advanced economically and move along the tourism heritage Kuznets curve. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper formally tests, for the first time, for the presence of a Kuznets curve in the relationship between heritage protection spending and tourism income. It provides original evidence of the value of applying the underlying theory of the Kuznets curve in a tourism context.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:58","2025-07-06 19:52:14","","","","","","","Tourism Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among other topics, geographers have looked into the privatization and neo-liberal splintering of urban infrastructures; the failings of infrastructures and the power relations revealed within these failings; the political ecology of infrastructural provisions; the specific infrastructural challenges of cities within the so-called Global South; and the entanglements of everyday experiences, affects and emotions with infrastructures. Yet, little attention has been drawn to the ways in which infrastructures need to be learned to fulfil their role of smoothly providing people with diverse services. Given the increasing spatial mobility of populations (e.g., as refugees, migrants, expatriates, and tourists), as well as the accelerating pace of infrastructural change (e.g., in the name of Smart City developments) however, it has become more salient than ever to open-up urban infrastructural research more explicitly towards critical inquiries of learning. Thus, this paper proposes to rethink urban infrastructures not only as socio-material configurations, but more specifically as important spaces for learning.

The primary aim of our review is to systematically identify and critically review the literature on sustainable innovation in H&amp;T amid COVID-19 (conducted in 2020 and 2021), in order to synthesize and classify prevalent types, antecedents, and outcomes of sustainable innovation. The authors present a comprehensive review of the 58 articles on sustainable innovation in H&amp;T through the Web of Science (WoS) database, spanning over 2 years (2020–2021). This review demonstrates that since the beginning of COVID-19, H&amp;T have strongly mobilized network technologies (especially social media and digital platforms) and data-processing technologies (especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)) in comparison with physical-digital interface technologies (especially Virtual Reality (VR)), while physical-digital process technologies remain very limited in these industries. Several relevant antecedents of the adoption of sustainable innovation, more specifically digital technologies, have been identified at multiple levels of analysis, including the organizational, managerial, and stakeholder levels. Our research also reveals several consequences of the adoption of sustainable innovation in H&amp;T. These consequences were congregated according to the three main dimensions related to sustainability in economic, social, and environmental outcomes.

Aesthetic principles of architecture, technological integration, and skill development are key factors that impact architectural design outcomes and broader societal implications. The purpose of this research is to look into the impact of architectural aesthetic principles on socioeconomic development, public well-being, and architectural modernism, while also looking into the mediating role of technological integration and the moderating role of skill development. A quantitative research approach was adopted, using a cross-sectional design. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire from 375 architects in Guangzhou, representing diverse architectural practices. SPSS was used for descriptive and inferential statistical analyses such as correlation, regression, and mediation analysis. The study revealed a positive relationship between aesthetic principles of architecture and socio-economic development, indicating that aesthetically pleasing designs can foster economic growth and urban development. Moreover, aesthetics significantly influenced public well-being, with thoughtfully designed spaces positively impacting the emotional and psychological well-being of users. Aesthetic principles were found to contribute to architecture modernity, inspiring innovative design practices. Technological integration emerged as a mediator, highlighting its role in translating aesthetic concepts into sustainable design solutions that impact socio-economic development, public well-being, and architecture modernity. Skill development was identified as a moderator, enhancing the integration of aesthetics and technology in architectural design. This study advances the understanding of the interplay between aesthetics, technology, and skill development in architectural practice. The findings offer practical implications for architects, policymakers, and educators, guiding the creation of aesthetically-driven, sustainable, and socially impactful designs. The study contributes to architectural theory and practice, fostering a holistic approach toward the creation of built environments that enhance the quality of life for individuals and promote sustainable development.

Besides, it is difficult for general users to create their own VR/AR applications and foster their creative ideas without advanced programming skills. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an interactive extended reality toolkit, named BlocklyXR. The objective of this research is to provide general users with a visual programming environment to build an extended reality application for digital storytelling. The contextual design was generated from real-world map data retrieved from Mapbox GL. ThreeJS was used for setting up, rendering 3D environments, and controlling animations. A block-based programming approach was adapted to let users design their own story. The capability of BlocklyXR was illustrated with a use case where users were able to replicate the existing PalmitoAR utilizing the block-based authoring toolkit with fewer efforts in programming. The technology acceptance model was used to evaluate the adoption and use of the interactive extended reality toolkit. The findings showed that visual design and task technology fit had significantly positive effects on user motivation factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness).

Large-panel buildings constitute a large housing stock throughout Europe. This paper presents the possibility of using laser scanning to identify typical assembly defects in large-panel buildings. Based on point cloud data, numerical models were created to assess the impact of improper assembly on the elements’ performance. It was indicated that using scanning to identify and monitor the displacement of structural elements does not relieve experts of the need to perform other tests. Analyses related to the possibility of using Building Information Modeling technology to manage large-panel buildings were also conducted. A parametric model was made, from which a number of possibilities of its use at every stage of the building’s life were presented in an example. It was highlighted that parametric models of large-panel buildings, due to their repeatable geometry, can be copied for use in managing entire neighbourhoods.

While numerous studies have focused on how smart city initiatives either undermine or contribute to sustainability, a few essential questions remain unanswered. First, a vast body of knowledge has been accumulated on the results of smart cities, particularly their short-term outputs. However, it is not clear how those results can be sustained over time. Second, most of the existing literature touches on environmental and economic sustainability, whereas other perspectives, such as social and cultural sustainability, are still underexplored. Given these gaps, this study seeks to contribute to the sustainability and smart city literature by answering the following research questions: (1) To what extent have the results of smart city initiatives been addressed in previous studies? and (2) To what extent have smart city scholars addressed the different dimensions of sustainability? A narrative literature review was conducted. Our findings indicate that the sustainability of smart cities can be understood in two ways—the duration of results and the multi-dimensional long-term sustainability goals.

Moreover, prior studies have highlighted some key factors influencing the sustainable business models (SBMs) of tourism firms but have mainly done so by adopting static perspectives. Thus, how these firms can contribute to sustainability through their BMs with positive effects, particularly on natural resources, remains overlooked. Thus, we adopt coevolutionary lenses to explore the main processes surrounding tourism firms’ SBM. Coevolution conceives the firm–environment relationship as both circular, with mutual influence and reciprocal changes, and dialectical. Accordingly, we analyze 28 Italian agritourism firms during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency period focusing on the dynamics of their relationship with various multilevel actors (including institutions, local communities, tourists) by considering internal and external factors influencing their SBM. The dialectical nature of this relationship is stressed. We find three new factors: sustainable tourism culture, tourist loyalty, and local natural resource setting. Moreover, from the coevolutionary analysis of the findings, we derive a framework that conceptualizes agritourism SBMs as a virtuous coevolutionary process through effective coadaptations between multilevel actors influenced by 12 factors. Tourism entrepreneurs and policy-makers should carefully consider the factors influencing SBMs and try to act upon them to effectively organize and manage relationships of mutual functionality in light of current challenges, especially environmental concerns.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-06 19:47:57","","","","","","","Environmental Science and Pollution Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the global built environment landscape is undergoing rapid changes. These changes are steeped in three fundamental imperatives, which have serious implications for the developing world. These imperatives are population growth and rising urbanisation; environmental challenges, particularly climate change and the quest to embrace sustainability as a panacea; and advances in technological development. This paper discusses these three imperatives with the view to teasing out their implications for urban development and management in the developing world. Consistent with the literature, the paper establishes that most of the population growth and rising urbanisation are occurring in the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia, and although these phenomena have the tendency to increase economic density and promote both private and public investment in urban development, especially construction/housing and related infrastructure activities, there are and will be several problems with them. These include land tenure insecurity, lack of access to decent affordable housing and the threat of destruction to heritage sites. Furthermore, environmental challenges such as poor waste management, and climate change are and will remain pressing issues requiring the adoption of sustainability credentials because of legislative requirements, moral suasion, and value addition. Despite the potential disruptive nature of technology with respect to some aspects of the built environment, it is recognised that advances in technology are essential to the achievement of optimal urban development and management outcomes in the developing world. The paper, therefore, recommends better understanding of the socio-economic, cultural, and political forces underlying urban growth in the developing world, factoring in technology and sustainability in urban development and management, and collaboration among relevant actors, particularly government and the private sector, for optimal outcomes.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-05 19:15:12","","","","","","","Land","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper takes the case of Yezhai Middle School in Qianshan, Anhui Province, to explore wind environment optimization and facade energy-saving strategies for mountainous campus buildings under existing building stock renovation. In the context of smart city development, integrating advanced technologies and sustainable practices into public infrastructure has become a key objective. Through wind environment simulations and facade energy retrofitting, this study reveals nonlinear increases in wind speed with building height and significant effects of ground roughness on wind speed variations. Adopting EPS panels and insulation layers in facade energy retrofitting reduces energy consumption for winter heating and summer cooling. The renovated facade effectively prevents cold air intrusion and reduces external heat gain, achieving approximately 24% energy savings. This research provides a scientific basis and practical experience for low-carbon energy retrofitting of other campus and public buildings, advancing the construction industry towards green and low-carbon development goals within the framework of smart city initiatives.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-06 19:52:49","","","","","","","Smart Cities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the study, it is proposed to consider management culture as a potential factor that determines the competitive management of the network structure of supply chains. Despite numerous studies dedicated to supply chains digitalization, there’s lack of researches dedicated to deep investigation of management culture transformation in context of the digitalization of supply chains requires. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to identify the determinants contributing to the transformation of management culture in context of supply chain digitalization. METHODS: The study is conceptual research that links management culture and the supply chain. Based on the evolutionary dynamism of the theory and practice of management culture, two aspects of culture have been identified: national psychology (subjective beliefs) and company potential (values and behaviour of personnel). RESULTS: It is assumed that the most effective culture in context of supply chain digitalization is digital culture as it is focused on the external environment. It has been found that the key determinants of the change are the values and behaviour of the personnel, and as a result, they create an effective approach to the management culture transformation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study allow managers to assess the established organizational culture that facilitates or hinders the activities of the business in order to successfully implement and achieve the goals set.

This technology arises with other significant advances in the field of sensors fusion for human-centric 3D capturing. Recent advances for scanning the user environment, real-time visualization and 3D vision using ubiquitous systems like smartphones allow us to capture 3D data from the real world. In this paper, a disruptive application for assessing the status of indoor infrastructures is proposed. The installation and maintenance of hidden facilities such as water pipes, electrical lines and air conditioning tubes, which are usually occluded behind the wall, supposes tedious and inefficient tasks. Most of these infrastructures are digitized but they cannot be visualized onsite. In this research, we focused on the development of a new application (GEUINF) to be launched on smartphones that are capable of capturing 3D data of the real world by depth sensing. This information is relevant to determine the user position and orientation. Although previous approaches used fixed markers for this purpose, our application enables the estimation of both parameters with a centimeter accuracy without them. This novelty is possible since our method is based on a matching process between reconstructed walls of the real world and 3D planes of the replicated world in a virtual environment. Our markerless approach is based on scanning planar surfaces of the user environment and then, these are geometrically aligned with their corresponding virtual 3D entities. In a preprocessing phase, the 2D CAD geometry available from an architectural project is used to generate 3D models of an indoor building structure. In real time, these virtual elements are tracked with the real ones modeled by using ARCore library. Once the alignment between virtual and real worlds is done, the application enables the visualization, navigation and interaction with the virtual facility networks in real-time. Thus, our method may be used by private companies and public institutions responsible of the indoor facilities management and also may be integrated with other applications focused on indoor navigation.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-06 19:52:58","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urine samples were obtained during physical examinations and 524 of them were considered valid, including 87 normal samples and 437 abnormal dry chemistry parameters samples. The urinalysis included both micro- and macro-levels, in which the CIE L*a*b* values and routine urine chemical examination were performed through digital imaging colorimetry and a urine chemical analyzer, respectively.Results: The results showed that L* (53.49 vs. 56.69) in the abnormal urine dry chemistry group was lower than the normal group, while b* (37.39 vs. 33.80) was greater. Urine color can be initially classified based on shade by grouping b*. Abnormal urine dry chemical parameter samples were distributed more in the dark-colored group. Urine dry chemical parameters were closely related to Ucol. Urine specific gravity (USG), protein, urobilinogen, bilirubin, occult blood, ketone body, pH, and the number of abnormal dry chemical parameters were all correlated with Ucol CIE L*a*b*; according to a stepwise regression analysis, it was determined that more than 50% of the variation in the three-color space values came from the urine dry chemical parameters, and the b* value was most affected by USG (standardized coefficient β = 0.734, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Based on a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, Ucol ≥ 4 provided moderate sensitivity and good specificity (AUC = 0.892) for the detection of USG ≥ 1.020.Conclusions: Our findings on the Ucol analysis showed that grouping Ucol based on b* value is an objective, simple, and practical method. At the same time, the results suggested that digital imaging colorimetry for Ucol quantification is a potential method for evaluating body hydration and, potentially, health.","2021","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-05 18:59:50","","","","","","","Frontiers in Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, obtaining the social and environmental license to operate TSFs has become a challenging process for mining companies. This has promoted the trend of using mine tailings dewatering technologies in the mining industry, with dry stacking of filtered mine tailings being recognized worldwide as one of the most acceptable, safe, and environmentally friendly solutions. This article presents a new paradigm in managing mine tailings, with disruptive and futuristic characteristics, considering the dry stacking of filtered mine tailings for large-scale industrial production rates over 100,000 metric tons per day (mtpd). Aspects of filtered tailings management are discussed, such as (i) dewatering process plant with thickening/filtering equipment, (ii) conveyance using fixed and movable conveyor belts, (iii) construction of dry stacking of filtered mine tailings facility, and (iv) implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for automation of the mining processes. Finally, the article discusses how the large-scale filtered mine tailings solution is applied, considering the advances in the equipment’s performance and implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies as well as the experience gained worldwide in several mining operations. The future global trend is that mining operations with high daily production of mine tailings will apply dry stacking technology without dams to guarantee sustainability, promote continuity of the mining business, ensure the safety of communities, and conserve the environment.","2023","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-06 19:58:07","","","","","","","Minerals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many Points of Interest (POIs) are available, creating an information overload for tourists when choosing POIs to visit. For this reason, CARS (Context-Aware Recommendation Systems) can play an important role by exploiting the experiences of previous tourists and their contexts to recommend attractive POIs. Consequently, choosing the right POI recommendation algorithm (RA) for CARS is crucial because it involves the costly intervention of real tourists during the test phase. In order to make this phase more cost-effective, we can test several RAs simultaneously in order to assess their limitations in terms of cold start and tourist satisfaction. To compare these RAs, we propose in this article an approach called SEPRA (Systematic Evaluation for POI Recommendation Algorithms), which allows us to carry out an initial online evaluation of each tourist during their visit and a second offline evaluation of each CARS after the end of each POI path. To achieve this objective, we designed and implemented a new smart tourism tool that makes POI recommendations using two algorithms: the first is based on tourist/tourist similarity, and the second uses POI/POI similarity. These algorithms use memory-based collaborative filtering and are executed in parallel by our tool in the form of CARSs, incorporating time or weather as context variables. To evaluate these systems during their test phases, Our approach enables: (1) the calculation of prediction accuracy; (2) the examination of the relevance of the recommended POIs; and (3) the estimation of the acceptance rate of the recommendation process. Finally, the experimental results obtained with our approach show that the algorithm based on tourist similarity is more resistant to the cold start problem during the test phase and has a better satisfaction rate than the algorithm based on POI similarity.","2024","2025-07-05 00:15:59","2025-07-07 22:32:16","","","","","","","International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INCLUIR; NO_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the Octopus data collector was used to collect online evaluation data from nine target platforms, and ROST CM6 was used to analyse the data for word frequency analysis, semantic network analysis, and sentiment analysis. Finally, using Nvivo12, the data was coded and a multidimensional model of landscape perception was constructed: natural landscapes, cultural and social landscapes, perceived landscapes, seasonal landscapes, and services and infrastructures. The results show that in the landscape perception model, the cultural and social landscape modules are the core factors affecting tourists’ psychological perceptions, with most tourists holding positive emotions towards the scenic spots and a few negative emotions mainly focusing on the relatively weak natural landscape, the unsatisfactory road system and charging system, and the over-commercialised development. In response to these problems, this study proposes corresponding planning recommendations. The results of the study reflect the trend of deep integration of culture and tourism in traditional villages in China, respond to the policy guidance of China’s rural revitalisation policy, and provide useful references and insights for the landscape construction and development of the Xijiang Thousand Households Miao Village and even similar tourist-oriented traditional villages.","2024","2025-07-05 00:16:00","2025-07-06 20:01:11","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such systems have the ability to acquire information fast and reliably, making them ideal for SHM applications. Historical buildings, having been exposed to the wear of time, are especially sensitive to any kind of intervention. As a result, keeping them as intact as possible is a critical factor for their integrity. In the current work, a low-cost WSN system and a synchronization algorithm are developed in order to be employed for SHM of historical buildings. The synchronization of WSN-based SHM systems is critical for the collection of accurate information describing the building’s condition. The effectiveness of the assumed hardware and the synchronization algorithm were evaluated with two experiments. The first took place under laboratory conditions and its results showcase the algorithm’s accuracy of synchronization. The second experiment was conducted in a real-world environment. For that purpose, the Ionian Campus Testbed was chosen since it comprises buildings that are more than 200 years old. These buildings are appropriate since they were built with thick stone walls which help determine the system’s effectiveness under such conditions. The results derived from the second experiment showcase the effects of the packet transmission collision avoidance mechanism utilized by the assumed hardware. Finally, an estimation of the average clock skew required for accurate information gathering is derived, based on the materials comprising a historical building.","2020","2025-07-05 00:16:00","2025-07-05 19:29:27","","","","","","","Heritage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While IP and data are significant for economic development, there are very limited studies on their co-ownership regimes especially on co-ownership of open data and open intellectual property. This study address this gap.Design/methodology/approachThis study is qualitative. In total, 62 in-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out, with predominantly senior members of organisations actively involved in smart city projects. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.FindingsThere are three models of co-ownership of IP and data: contractual joint ownership, undetermined or not-yet-determined ownership and open ownership. Each ownership model impacts differently the value-in-use. The relationships between actors in the consortia affect the way in which they co-create IP and data.Originality/valueThis study demonstrates how projects that operate in new models of innovation-led consortia produce new types of resources that are not simply co-created but co-owned. Co-owned resources have different value-in-use for each one of the different actors, independently of the fact that they jointly own them. This is influenced by the type of ownership model and predisposition of the actors to initially share resources and be flexible.

Findings suggest that there are significant opportunities to further explore the connections between cocreation and tourism experience, considered as a multi-actor process based on engagement leading to innovation, and enabling new tourist experiences. Five perspectives on tourism experience emerged from the analysis: firminspired, technology-based, and cultural-based experience; customer satisfaction and participation, and innovation-based experience. These suggest several potential research streams as tourism experiences are recognized to be dynamically co-created through a participatory and engaging process by multiple actors using innovative and technology-based value propositions.

Indeed, systems that analyse and interpret user-generated content can extract actionable information from the digital world to improve citizens’ quality of life. This article aims to model the knowledge required for automatic problem detection to reproduce citizens’ awareness of problems from the analysis of text-based user-generated content items. Therefore, this research focuses on two primary goals. On the one hand, we present the underpinnings of the ontological model that categorises the types of problems affecting citizens’ quality of life in society. In this regard, this study contributes significantly to developing an ontology based on the social-sensing paradigm to support the advance of smart societies.

Yet, not numerous such investigations centered on synergies inside the assorted characters of tourism and their businesses. Besides, meaningful aid to promote local settlements and sustainability in provincial districts is not modestly perceived. Hence the foremost aim is to appraise a strategy for consolidating tourism as an instrument for sustainable local community development (SLMD). The examination reasons that Musina Municipality has abundant tourism feasibilities and natural resources but requires a more diverse dependable tourism plan around the ecotourism market to permit the local inhabitants while promoting environmental sustainability.Design/methodology/approachTo grasp the dynamics of tourism actualities and their management around the communities in the Municipality, Focus group discussion (FGDs), surveys, interviews and existing document inspections, supplemented by field observations, were appropriated. Consequently, Microsoft Excel, Cross-tabulation and manual sorting of data interpretation systematized the exploration of the data. The features supplementing the antecedent and modern tourism states toward sustainable-eco-tourism enterprises and assorted welfare in Musina Municipality got explained.FindingsThis study exposes an inoperative unity between sustainable tourism initiatives and ecotourism imperatives. The aforesaid could work enthusiastically on multiple forms of rural tourism in the adjoining local populations and the uprightness of urban tourism in Musina town.

This study examines how phygital interactive in‐store technologies are perceived in the specific context of luxury retail by providing a holistic picture of the characteristics consumers link to technological applications. Employing correspondence analysis, we highlight the contribution of the affective and cognitive dimensions of beliefs to technology evaluation, both in positive and negative terms. By differentiating between respondents who had already tried the technology and those who had not, the findings reveal how negative bias, derived from a lack of experience, results in negative evaluations; while previous usage of the technology positively impacts technology assessment. The results provide an outline of a valuable customer in‐store experience enriched by phygital devices, showing how technology's distinct features attract consumers, and how these perceptions can be leveraged by the retailer to enhance the retail experience.","2024","2025-07-05 00:16:00","2025-07-05 19:39:04","","","","","","","International Journal of Consumer Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This poses a significant barrier for researchers to replicate or interpret the findings. Hence, this research aims to conduct a systematic literature review of the current FMM practices in Malaysia. The review processes comprised five key methodological steps, namely review, formulation of research questions, systematic searching strategies based on identification, screening, and eligibility on various established databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. This is then followed by quality appraisal, as well as data extraction and analysis. Four primary themes were identified based on the thematic analyses: (1) FMM evolution; (2) the current state of FMM; (3) technology; and (4) policy and regulation. These four themes were then divided into nine sub-themes. Findings show that despite the progress, FMM still faces challenges, particularly in standardizing the maintenance process, which impacts on overall service quality.","2024","2025-07-05 00:16:00","2025-07-05 19:34:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a robot can operate using basic sensor feedback under controlled conditions, achieving micro-level accuracy requires more comprehensive data integration, especially in dynamic environments. The fusion of data from a variety of sensors is necessary for improving the positioning accuracy of a robot because the accuracy of one type of sensor is insufficient. The field of micro-positioning presents new challenges and tasks that have been gradually explored in the recent literature published from 2015 to 2025. Micro-positioning is a complex operation that involves factors such as mechanical drift, environmental effects, and sensor signal errors. Hybrid fusion is a sensor fusion technique that combines elements of fusion at different levels. For the effective deployment of robots in such contexts, it is essential to integrate multiple sensors and ensure reliable data fusion between them. This involves the use of different sensors, advanced fusion algorithms, and accurate calibration methods through sensor fusion and sophisticated data processing techniques. This literature review presents an analysis of the sensor data fusion methods for precise robot micro-positioning. The focus is on the investigated sensors, the applied synthesis methods, and the developed algorithms and their practical application to identify the existing gaps for future system improvements. Finally, discussions and conclusions based on the collected ideas are presented.","2025","2025-07-05 00:16:00","2025-07-06 19:51:07","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism contributed 10.3% to the global GDP and employed 333 million people but saw a significant decline due to the pandemic. Sustainable and smart tourism requires collaboration from all stakeholders and a comprehensive understanding of global and local issues to drive responsible and innovative growth in the sector. This paper presents an approach for leveraging big data and deep learning to discover holistic, multi-perspective (e.g., local, cultural, national, and international), and objective information on a subject. Specifically, we develop a machine learning pipeline to extract parameters from the academic literature and public opinions on Twitter, providing a unique and comprehensive view of the industry from both academic and public perspectives. The academic-view dataset was created from the Scopus database and contains 156,759 research articles from 2000 to 2022, which were modelled to identify 33 distinct parameters in 4 categories: Tourism Types, Planning, Challenges, and Media and Technologies. A Twitter dataset of 485,813 tweets was collected over 18 months from March 2021 to August 2022 to showcase the public perception of tourism in Saudi Arabia, which was modelled to reveal 13 parameters categorized into two broader sets: Tourist Attractions and Tourism Services. The paper also presents a comprehensive knowledge structure and literature review of the tourism sector based on over 250 research articles. Discovering system parameters are required to embed autonomous capabilities in systems and for decision-making and problem-solving during system design and operations.

The circular economy is one of the most interesting facets of the latter. Nevertheless, no substantial effort has been made so far to establish the link between the circular economy and smart cities.Purpose of the paper: Through the conceptual systemic perspective and quantitative means, the study investigates how the concepts of the smart sustainable city and the circular economy are interconnected.Methodology: After assessing the related scholarly literature to highlight the systemic nature of the connection between a smart sustainable city and a circular economy, we analyze the relationship between the two by operationally quantifying both concepts on the macro level and the level of the single components of smartness and circularity. Operationalizations are based on the relative frequencies with which certain EU cities are mentioned in scholarly documents related to smartness and the circular economy and indexed on Google Scholar. Regression analysis and principal component analysis are used as the main analytical tools.Findings: We find a significant positive relationship between a city's smartness and circularity. While the presence of specific smart city-related technologies like AI, Big Data, and IoT are less important for the proliferation of circular economy initiatives in a city, the same is not true for the overall presence of an advanced ICT infrastructure. Alternatively, waste management is the element of the circular economy that contributes the most to sustainable urban smartness.Research limits: The analysis is performed on a dataset consisting of 193 EU cities. Therefore, the results cannot be applied to cities outside the EU. Moreover, the indices that operationalize sustainable smartness and circularity are empirically valid but require more in-depth statistical validation.Practical implications: The study suggests city managers and administrators to treat the smart sustainable city concept holistically. Indeed, circular economy initiatives could significantly affect the implementation of smart sustainable urban initiatives.Originality of the paper: Although the literature treats the two concepts extensively, no attempts to quantify the relationship between smart sustainable cities and circular economy have been made until now. We hope this study will shed additional light on the complex systemic nature of the investigated domains.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:01","2025-07-06 20:04:18","","","","","","","Sinergie Italian Journal of Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the main objective of this research is to redefine the sustainable pillars linked to food production and review the most important cultural and technological sustainability impacts they have, in addition to the three classic pillars: economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Cultural and technological sustainability are increasingly important complements to the traditional sustainability concept. Furthermore, new food production technologies and systems are influenced by ancient production methods, as well as by profitable crop selection. Traditional agricultural and aquaculture production in relation to more recent aquaponic production concepts are still a major part of global food security, but the better usage of waste materials or residues generates a more favorable agroecological impact.

This is aimed at enriching tourists’ experiences and improving their satisfaction. The purpose of the present paper is to enhance tourists’ experiences and to increase tourists’ satisfaction using smart technologies and to identify experts’ perspectives regarding the use of these technologies. This research was conducted using quantitative and qualitative research. In the process of data collection, the research involved a questionnaire which focused on tourists’ experiences with various smart technologies and their intentions to return to the visited region. An exploratory factor analysis was applied to determine the elements of satisfaction and their attribute levels in different Romanian touristic regions. This study employed an analysis of variance to determine whether groups with different reasons for visiting exhibit varying levels of satisfaction and whether the touristic regions under investigation generate differing levels of satisfaction. Cross-tabulation and a Pearson’s chi-square test were used to determine whether the tourists’ segment influenced their intention to revisit specific regions. The research was augmented using qualitative research based on the Delphi technique to identify experts’ opinion on the impact of smart tourism technologies on the Romanian tourism industry. This study presents a global perspective on the current situation of smart technologies in the Romanian tourism sector. The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between tourists’ satisfaction and their perception of the value of smart technologies. The use of smart technologies has a positive impact on the experiences of tourists during all phases of their journey. Romania’s tourism capabilities can support the development of smart and sustainable tourism. Smart technologies have a double role in the tourism industry. They can enhance satisfaction by introducing new experiences while also improving the operational efficiency and sustainability of tourist destinations. The use of smart solutions will be essential in creating smooth and unforgettable tourist experiences as the industry develops. Their theoretical and practical implications are deduced.

The oases in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), are one of the historical sites and were inscribed as cultural sites in 2011 by UNESCO World Heritage Committee. This study assessed the threats to oases based on the UNESCO-listed factors affecting the outstanding universal value of the World Heritage properties. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with remote sensing was used for data collection and analysis. Expert feedback showed that water, urban expansion, soil salinity, palm disease, and the legal framework were major threats. To determine whether urban expansion influences oases preservation, remote sensing images were used to investigate land use and land cover (LULC) around the oases. The LULC change between 1972 and 2022 showed that palm trees, grass, and built-up areas increased by 59%, 76%, and 91%, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were used to assess stress in the oases. The results indicated that oases have not been impacted by urban expansion since 1972, reflecting the UAE’s commitment to the preservation of oases. The availability of cloud-based and open-access satellite images coupled with AHP is an effective tool for understanding threats. This research aligns with UN SDG 15—“Life on Land”. The concept of this study could be used to assess threats to historical sites. It is recommended that policies for the oases’ preservation be maintained and updated to cater to issues related to population and climate change. Gray water and smart irrigation systems could be assessed as alternatives to minimize water use. Hyperspectral remote sensing is recommended for future studies related to soil salinity and palm diseases.","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:01","2025-07-06 19:47:37","","","","","","","Land","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The need to extend sensing technology through the use of wireless sensors as well as the lack of description tools for understanding, visualizing, and documenting sensor outputs has encouraged researchers to use powerful tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems. BIM has become important because of conducting tools widely used in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to present and manage information on structural systems and situations. Since combining health monitoring and maintenance results with BIM models is a new field of study, and most projects utilize various aspects of it, we have conducted a review of important work related to this subject published from 2010 to November of 2020. After reviewing 278 journal articles, research trends, approaches, methods, gaps, and future agenda related to BIM in monitoring and maintenance were highlighted. This paper, through a bibliometric and content analysis, concludes that besides main improvements, some limitations now exist which affect the modeling and maintenance process. These limitations are related to extending the IFC schema, optimizing sensor data, interoperability among various BIM platforms, optimization of various sensing technologies for fault detection and management of huge amounts of data, besides consideration of environmental effects on monitoring hazards and underground objects. Finally, this paper aims to help to solve the mentioned limitation through a comprehensive review of existing research.","2021","2025-07-05 00:16:01","2025-07-05 19:00:53","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Careful planning for and accommodation of accelerating urbanization and citizenization (i.e., migrants gaining official urban residency) may be the best approach to limit some of the worst impacts. However, we find that another trajectory may be possible: one linked to the rural development plan adopted in the latest Chinese national development strategy. This plan aims to build rural areas as attractive areas for settlement by 2050 rather than to further urbanize with more people in cities. We assess the political motivations and challenges behind this choice to develop rural areas based on a literature review and empirical case analysis. After assessing the rural and urban policy subsystem, we find five socio-political drivers behind China’s rural development strategy, namely ensuring food security, promoting culture and heritage, addressing overcapacity, emphasizing environmental protection and eradicating poverty. To develop rural areas, China needs to effectively resolve three dilemmas: (1) implementing decentralized policies under central supervision; (2) deploying limited resources efficiently to achieve targets; and (3) addressing competing narratives in current policies. Involving more rural community voices, adopting multiple forms of local governance, and identifying and mitigating negative project impacts can be the starting points to manage these dilemmas.","2021","2025-07-05 00:16:01","2025-07-06 20:04:24","","","","","","","Land","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When hedonic dimensions are controlled, it was found that integrity, transparency, responsivity, interactivity, and serviceability are significant predictors of satisfaction. When utilitarian dimensions are controlled, only integrity, transparency, interactivity and serviceability are significant related to satisfaction. This study contributes to the policing and service quality research because limited studies demonstrate how smart policing service quality dimensions drive satisfaction. This research extends beyond current e-service quality models by addressing the importance of utilitarian dimension in police services quality.

Users are required to provide consent multiple times, often unexpectedly, at different game levels. This process is further complicated by the varying durations for which consent remains valid. As a result, users—especially minors—may become confused about the consent they have given. Additional concerns arise when the educational game is AI-equipped. If AI is not involved, no new data is generated. However, if AI is present, new data is continuously produced, necessitating ongoing consent. For example, a user may consent to personalisation, which could lead the game to categorise them in unintended ways, such as labelling them a ‘poor student’. This paper explores GDPR challenges in AI-empowered educational games, focusing on user consent, AI-inferred data, and compliance gaps. Intelligent educational games rely on adaptive decision-making algorithms to personalise learning experiences, making them a subset of Intelligent Decision Technologies. Our research is based on a fuzzy-based educational game developed as a testbed for studying GDPR compliance in AI-driven decision-making. The findings provide insights into ethical AI governance, dynamic consent management, and the intersection of regulatory compliance with adaptive, data-driven decision systems in intelligent educational technologies. Based on our research, not all personal data exist from the beginning and upon original consent granting, as personal data are also generated throughout the process.","2025","2025-07-05 00:16:01","2025-07-06 20:07:13","","","","","","","Intelligent Decision Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a hypothesis which is drawn from related literature, quantifiable measures variables with a 1–5 Likert scale, hypothesis testing and draws the inference about a phenomenon of switching the behavior of SMEs from traditional marketing to e-commerce from the sample of 100 owners of batik SMEs, which are located in Yogyakarta, Solo and Pekalongan. The study used partial least square with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to test the hypothesis. Findings The result of hypothesis testing indicates that two factors significantly influence the switching behavior of batik SMEs from physical store retailing to e-commerce. The first factor is the desire of SMEs to support the information searching behavior of their customers, and the second factor is the perception that adopting e-commerce can provide value for the SMEs. However, this study fails to prove that the attractiveness of e-commerce can significantly pull the switching behavior of batik SMEs from physical store retailing to e-commerce. Moreover, related to mooring factors, the results show that the computer self-efficacy of the SME owners as a moderating effect is not supported. Research limitations/implications This study has several limitations. First, the samples were restricted to the SMEs of batik in three cities (Yogyakarta, Solo and Pekalongan). It is significant to conduct cross-sector, cross countries, cross-region or even cross-cultural investigations on this subject for better explanations of the results from a global perspective. Studies on cultural differences in switching behavior are supposed to accommodate to different individuals from the SME owner. Second, the study does not differentiate the sizes of enterprises; that is, no test was conducted for small-, medium- and large-size enterprises. The study only focuses on SMEs. Different empirical results may be obtained for different sizes because each enterprise size can have a different condition in e-commerce adoption. Second, this study pays more attention to the product categories of stamped batik and hand-drawn batik. Consumers can have dissimilar favorite channels to purchase other types of batik. Future research should also consider this issue. Practical implications Within all the opportunities available through e-commerce (support the information searching behavior, save the travel time and travel cost, better service quality to their customer, a lower price to their customer as well, and increase their sales), the SMEs need to enhance e-commerce activities and put it in their strategy for moving forward. On the other side, the government should have a strong interest in helping and supporting the SME through several activities. Social implications The research confirms that e-commerce adoption may benefit SMEs. It may encourage more SMEs to move from the traditional physical store retailing to e-commerce. Originality/value Although this study uses the conceptual model from the study of Chang et al. (2017), significant differences exist between the two studies. This study uses the PPM framework in the context of the seller migratory decision, whereas in most studies, the PPM framework is used in the context of the consumer migratory decision. Moreover, most studies about the adoption of e-commerce by owners of SMEs use the theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, technology, organization and environment, and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as the framework.","2020","2025-07-05 00:16:02","2025-07-05 19:36:50","","","","","","","Journal of Enterprise Information Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach The methodology adopted in this study relies on the design science research, which includes five steps: problem identification, objective definition, solution design and development, demonstration and evaluation. Findings Results demonstrate how to exploit knowledge discovery and visualization to obtain multiple mappings of inner areas, in the aim to identify good practices and optimize resources to set up more effective territorial development strategies and plans. The proposed approach overcomes the traditional way adopted to map inner areas that uses a single indicator (i.e. the distance between a municipality and the nearest pole where it is possible to access to education, health and transportation services) and leverages seven groups of indicators that represent the distinguishing features of territories (territorial capital, social costs, citizenship, geo-demography, economy, innovation and sustainable development). Research limitations/implications The proposed model could be enriched by new variables, whose value can be collected by official sources and stakeholders engaged to provide both structured and unstructured data. Also, another enhancement could be the development of a cross-algorithms comparison that may reveal useful to suggest which algorithm can better suit the needs of policy makers or practitioners. Practical implications This study sets the ground for proposing a decision support tool that policy makers can use to classify in a new way the inner areas, thus overcoming the current approach and leveraging the distinguishing features of territories.

In this case, we only need to calculate pose of the camera relative to that surface. However, when an AR health or environmental application involves a one-to-one relationship between an entity in the real-world and the corresponding object in the computer model (geo-referenced object), we need to estimate the pose of the camera in reference to a common coordinate system for better geo-referenced object registration in the real-world. New innovations in developing cheap sensors, computer vision techniques, machine learning, and computing power have helped to develop applications with more precise matching between a real world and a virtual content. AR Tracking techniques can be divided into two subcategories: marker-based and marker-less approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of marker-less registration and tracking techniques and reviews their most important categories in the context of ubiquitous Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and AR focusing to health and environmental applications. Basic ideas, advantages, and disadvantages, as well as challenges, are discussed for each subcategory of tracking and registration techniques. We need precise enough virtual models of the environment for both calibrations of tracking and visualization.

To improve optical coordinate measurement using data fusion, researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic solutions and methods. The most popular examples are the Gaussian process (GP) and weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithms, which depend on user-defined mathematical models describing the geometric characteristics of the measured object. Existing research on GP and WLS algorithms indicates that GP algorithms have been widely applied in both academia and industry, despite their use being limited to applications on relatively simple geometries. Research on WLS algorithms is less common than research on GP algorithms, as the mathematical tools used in the WLS cases are too simple to be applied with complex geometries. Machine learning is a new technology that is increasingly being applied to data fusion applications. Research on this technology is relatively scarce, but recent work has highlighted the potential of machine learning methods with significant results. Unlike GP and WLS algorithms, machine learning algorithms can autonomously learn the geometrical features of an object. To understand existing research in-depth and explore a path for future work, a new taxonomy of data fusion algorithms is proposed, covering the mathematical background and existing research surrounding each algorithm type. To conclude, the advantages and limitations of the existing methods are reviewed, highlighting the issues related to data quality and the types of test artefacts.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:02","2025-07-06 20:07:30","","","","","","","The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart tourism destinations are territories based on information and communication technologies (ICT), which improve travelers’ tourist experiences as well as affect the quality of life of residents. To know the context of the relationships between tourism and quality of life, main studies and theories regarding these two phenomena are analyzed. Likewise, the relationship between smart places and quality of life is also studied. Therefore, a theoretical model on residents’ quality of life in smart tourism destinations is proposed based on a systematized analysis of the literature. From the theoretical model, it is perceived that residents’ overall life satisfaction results from the relationship between perceived tourism impacts and satisfaction with specific life factors, and they are measured by qualitative indicators. Also, it is identified that the quality of life of residents is clearly influenced by the impacts of tourism and ICTs. In addition, it is understood that the residents’ overall life satisfaction corroborates for the further development of the smart tourism destination. Finally, we understand that the knowledge of residents’ perception and satisfaction of their quality of life contribute to formulation and implementation of urban and tourism development policies in smart tourism destinations.","2020","2025-07-05 00:16:02","2025-07-05 19:34:52","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A scientific mapping was carried out in two stages using the VOSviewerTM software: a scientometric and a bibliometric analysis. This technique allowed us to analyse a large body of literature and bibliographic data to obtain trends, patterns and directions of this domain of knowledge. Then, a literature review was presented, highlighting the relevant information identified in the previous analysis. The fields of application of UAVs were delimited and the most commonly used payload types and the most appropriate post-processing techniques were specified, depending on the aerial mission objective. The fields of application identified included different techniques related to the generation of 3D models, land mapping, construction site monitoring, building surveying to detect structural damage and energy losses and urban remote sensing. The literature review showed that UAVs provide a useful multi-tasking tool at any stage of an architectural project.

The implications of this evolution on students in rural areas and their surrounding environments are ambiguous, presenting various obstacles within the educational sphere, particularly concerning rural learning environments. This study investigated the 4IR's potential to bridge digital divides and ensure equitable access to education in rural Zimbabwe, identifying prospects, challenges, and best practices. The research examined the impact of 4IR techniques on the academic performance of rural students using desktop exploration. It also highlighted educational opportunities for rural learning environments and emphasises the importance of localised collaboration. The link between e-learning and rural contexts in education, using secondary data from previous research was also examined. The study identified patterns and trends in implementing 4IR methodologies in education by using the content analysis to systematically scrutinise and interpret a large amount of textual data. The results indicated that student performance was impacted by technical, practical, and psychological impediments, additionally, academic and emotional decline due to remote learning was evident. Moreover, the study revealed that, despite challenges, 4IR methods offer multiple advantages, including enhanced information accessibility, distance learning opportunities, collaborative initiatives, personalised learning experiences, and teacher empowerment. To maximise these opportunities, the research recommended strategies such as infrastructure enhancement, resource accessibility, teacher professional development, curriculum adjustments, and collaborative efforts between public and private entities. Ultimately, the study proposed that rural environments can harness 4IR techniques in order to facilitate the quality of education and provide students with necessary digital skills by overcoming obstacles and taking advantage of opportunities.","2024","2025-07-05 00:16:02","2025-07-05 19:25:10","","","","","","","Futurity Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Innovations done by firms are blatantly used by other firms to develop cheap knock-off. This leads to huge economic loses to the firm investing in research and development activities. Firms are in need of trusted, immutable and verifiable means of storing information which cannot be used by others, even if publically available without their consent. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) appear to be one such solution to this problem that has recently attracted a lot of investor interest. Using NFTs the information is tokenized and is stored in a secure manner. Design/methodology/approach Through this scoping review, the authors investigate the influence of NFTs towards the innovation management from the dual aspects of management and information systems. This scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework by Arksey and O’Malley. The five stages of Arksey and O’Malley’s framework were used in this analysis to classify the literature through five stages of identifying the initial research questions; locating relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; and compiling, summarizing and reporting the results. Findings This study suggests that NFTs on the blockchain have significant potential to revolutionize innovation management and information systems. Theoretical frameworks used in investigating the role of digital tokens in blockchain management are mainly based on contracts, diversity theory, portfolio theory and faking likelihood theory. The study reveals gaps in the literature, particularly in the under-researched areas of behavioural psychology and social psychology theories. The appropriate regulation and regulation authority for different types of digital tokens are required. The study also presents archetypes that represent patterns in the current landscape of blockchain tokens, which have significant potential for future research and practical applications. Originality/value This study is unique in its approach to assessing the future of NFTs in the field of innovation and information management. While many existing reviews have focused on describing the progress and development of NFTs in the past, this study takes a forward-looking perspective and projects the future potential of NFTs. This innovative approach allows for a deeper understanding of the potential impact of NFTs in various fields such as entrepreneurship, innovation management and tokenomics. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature on NFTs by providing insights and recommendations for future research and practical applications.","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:02","2025-07-06 19:45:38","","","","","","","Journal of Knowledge Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, this paper uses the innovative AI device use acceptance (AIDUA) framework. This research evaluates the implications of human–machine interactions for the usage of robots and AI in daily life. Design/methodology/approach The proposed AIDUA model is tested using data collected from Millennials and Gen Z. First, a principal components analysis technique is used to validate each measure. Second, a multiple regression analysis using IBM SPSS 26.0 is conducted. Findings The results of this study suggest that human–machine interaction is a part of a complex process in which there are different elements determining individuals’ acceptance of the use of AI devices during daily life. This paper outlines both the theoretical and practical implications. This study enriches the AIDUA model by connoting it with features and emotions belonging to the younger generation. Additionally, this research offers technology companies suggestions for addressing future efforts on technical performance and on the alignments of the expectations of young people in Society 5.0. Originality/value First, the originality of this paper lies in highlighting the binary role of emotions in triggering the use of AI devices and robots.

The attempt to converge towards a model of sustainable urban life, made difficult by increasing anthropic pressure and polluting activities conducted by man, is also reflected in the intentions of public institutions to take measures of environmental risk mitigation. The change towards more liveable cities must also include the adoption of more far-reaching measures in various sectors. The objective of our work was to provide an analysis in order to assess which of the Italian provincial municipalities were most closely related to the paradigm of SSCs. This aim was pursued through a comparison based on the results of a partially non-compensatory quantitative method, known as the Pena’s Distance method (DP2). The smartest and most sustainable cities, such as Siena, Milan and Padua, were not identified on the basis of common urban characteristics but rather derived from the combination of distinctive and functional elements in the pursuit of a strategic approach aimed at fully exploiting the resources of each area. Moreover, at a macro-geographical level, from the analysis emerged the presence of contiguous clusters, i.e., areas in which a major concentration of smart sustainable municipalities tended to form.","2021","2025-07-05 00:16:03","2025-07-05 01:28:22","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For bibliometric analysis a citation network analysis, keyword cluster analysis, burst detection analysis and the total citation score are evaluated. So far, literature mainly deals with creation of digital building models. However, in the operational phase of a building, updating digital building models is essential in order to use the digital building models for applications like maintenance, facility management and conversion planning. In this paper approaches and methods to update digital building data are examined systematically to reflect the current state of scientific knowledge. This will identify and compare update approaches for digital building models. Nine interrelated research areas can be identified that deal with updating digital building information. Based on the body of knowledge on the topic ""Updating of digital building models"", research gaps and poorly represented research areas are identified. One gap in research is the use of photogrammetry to update individual buildings during their operational phase. In addition to strong research areas such as geoscience, which has produced update approaches over the years, areas like factory planning have been identified which hardly consider approaches to updating as-built data. Only the most important and largest research areas involved have been considered. A more detailed examination would be possible, but would go beyond the scope of this paper. This paper is the first to analyse updating approaches in a detailed, systematic, and bibliographic manner. The holistic view of the topic of updating approaches of digital building models helps to get an overview of existing approaches. Especially because in building operation up-to-date digital plan documents of the building are increasingly needed, this overview is necessary.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:03","2025-07-05 19:16:19","","","","","","","Journal of Information Technology in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, this phase could account for approximately 60% of the total life cycle costs of assets. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on the application of BIM in the O&amp;M phase to identify current research trends, research gaps and future directions. This study achieves the aforementioned purpose by adopting the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P). It employs qualitative and quantitative techniques to analyse the articles from a combination of three multi-disciplinary research databases, namely—Scopus, Web of Science and Engineering Village, which also comprises Compendex, InSpec, GeoRef and GeoBase sub-databases. After an in-depth review of 196 selected journal articles, this study systemically presents: (1) bibliometric analyses of the literature in BIM and O&amp;M; (2) research patterns and trends; (3) drivers and barriers to BIM–O&amp;M integration; and (4) research gaps mapped into a standard project management lifecycle to guide future research directions. The content analysis reveals that BIM has mainly been integrated under seven functions: information management (IM), advanced technology (AT), maintenance and asset management (MAM), indoor management (IM), performance assessment (PA), visualisation (V), and lean management (LM). Findings of the study reveal that the UK, USA and China are the top ranked countries with regards to research outputs on BIM–O&amp;M integrations. The majority of BIM integrations within O&amp;M falls under the information management function, whereas the least research output was recorded under lean management. In addition, the majority of studies focused on institutional and infrastructure facility types, but residential, industrial and commercial buildings were underrepresented, despite their disproportionate physical dominance within most societies. Findings also show that potential drivers and barriers for BIM integrations within O&amp;M can be classified into three main categories—technical, organisational, and legal/contractual. It is then concluded that the application of BIM within O&amp;M is still emerging, which further emphasises the need for more studies that address value realization in the context of BIM in O&amp;M, with particular focus on the specific O&amp;M principles for different building types.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:03","2025-07-05 01:33:10","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system is composed of four modules: an interregional computable general equilibrium (ICGE) model for the eastern mountain area (EMA) and the rest of Korea, a Bayesian wildfire model, a transportation demand model, and a tourist expenditure model. The model has a hierarchical structure, with the ICGE model serving as a core module to link to three other modules. In the impact analysis of a wildfire, three external shocks are injected into the ICGE model: (1) the wildfire damaged area derived from the Bayesian wildfire model, (2) changes in travel times among cities and counties derived from the transportation demand model, and (3) variations in visitors’ expenditures derived from the tourist expenditure model. The simulation shows that the gross regional product (GRP) of the EMA would decrease by 0.25% to 0.55% without climate change and by 0.51%–1.23% with climate change. This article contributes to the development of quantitative linkages between macro and micro spatial models in a bottom‐up system for the impact analysis of disasters, integrating a regional economic model with a place‐based disaster model and the demands of tourism and transportation.","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:03","2025-07-05 18:59:55","","","","","","","Risk Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper offers a systematic review of 303 studies on such initiatives to outline the potential of mobile apps in Citizen Science. Based distinctly on their specificities and the needs they address, three content categories were highlighted: a) monitoring tools, b) validation of techniques and methods to improve mobile technologies for Citizen Science, and c) participatory approaches of citizens employing mobile apps. The review also showed a susceptibility of several domains of activity towards Citizen Science, such as monitoring biodiversity and reconnecting people with nature, environmental risk monitoring or improving well-being.

At the same time, agriculture is a cause of environmental degradation, pollution and biodiversity loss. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is proposed as an approach that provides a roadmap to sustainable agricultural development. Despite this, farmer adoption rates of CSA practices and technologies in Europe remain low. This paper seeks to systematically review and synthesize the factors that facilitate or hinder farmers’ uptake of CSA in Europe. Out of the 2827 articles identified in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, a total of 137 research articles were included for analysis following the PRISMA methodology. The factors are categorized into seven categories, namely socio-demographics, psychological, farm characteristics, practice/technology-related attributes, biotic/abiotic, systemic and policy factors, with the majority of the studies focusing on the first four categories, while systemic and policy factors are relatively understudied. The results highlight for the first time that the adoption of CSA does not depend solely on farmer characteristics but also on the food systems and structures in which farmers operate, as well as the interactions with other value chain actors. To promote the adoption of CSA practices, extension and advisory services along with access to timely and reliable information, play a vital role in increasing awareness and in the provision of training and the encouragement of farmers’ behavioral shifts towards sustainable practices. From a technological point of view, adapting technologies to be easy to use, compatible with current farming objectives and cost-efficient will render them less risky investments for farmers and will foster adoption rates. Finally, support from the government in terms of financial support, subsidies and reduced bureaucratic procedures is crucial for motivating CSA adoption.","2024","2025-07-05 00:16:03","2025-07-06 19:54:36","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Barroso agro-sylvo-pastoral system is a clear example of this alignment between existing society, nature and natural resources, the environment, landscapes, and contextual heritage. Moreover, the sustainable use of existing natural resources, excellent environmental conditions, and breath-taking untouched landscapes represent a truly relevant factor towards the development of a region economy that is still greatly influenced by an engraved cultural, patrimonial, and agricultural heritage. Given the GIAHS classification attributed to that territory, the need arises to guarantee the existing environmental conditions. This context will allow the maintenance of the GIAHS classification, ensuring the quality of life in the region and stimulating its socio-economic development and overall sustainability. The present article describes a proposal for a digital ecosystem model aimed at the Barroso GIAHS, composed of four main functional hubs that actively interact with each other: smart environment, smart government, smart economy, and smart people. Based on wireless sensor networks, IoT, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and other technological solutions, this solution will allow real-time control of the territory’s environmental conditions and develop more efficient and well-supported management and governance.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:03","2025-07-06 19:59:48","","","","","","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, an AHP-ISM-MICMAC integrated hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model was developed and implemented. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the importance of each parameter, while interpretive structural modeling (ISM) was used to establish the interrelationships between the parameters. The cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis was employed to identify the driving and dependent parameters. A total of fifteen important parameters categorized into five major groups have been considered for this analysis from previously published works. The results showed that technological, budget, and environmental issues were the most critical parameters in implementing a sustainable AI cloud system. More specifically, the digitalization of innovative technologies is found to be the most crucial among the group from all aspects, having the highest priority degree and strong driving power. ISM reveals that all the factors are interconnected with each other and act as linkage barriers.

Urban expansion and densification processes reshape cities and, in particular, the third dimension (3D), thus calling for a technical shift from 2D to 3D for property valuation. However, most property valuation studies employ 2D geoinformation in hedonic price models, while the benefits of 3D modelling potentially brought for property valuation and the general context of digital twin (DT) creation are not sufficiently explored. Therefore, this review aims to identify appropriate urban 3D modelling method(s) for city DT, which can be used for 3D property valuation (3DPV) in the future (both short-term and long-term). We focused on 3D modelling studies investigating buildings and urban elements directly linked with residential properties. In total, 180 peer-reviewed journal papers were selected between 2016 and 2020 with a narrative review approach. Analytical criteria for 3D modelling methods were explicitly defined and covered four aspects: metadata, technical characteristics, users’ requirements, and ethical considerations. From this, we derived short-term and long-term prospects for 3DPV. The results provide references for integrating 3D modelling and DT in property valuation and call for interdisciplinary collaboration including researchers and stakeholders in the real estate sector, such as real estate companies, house buyers and local governments.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:04","2025-07-05 19:20:34","","","","","","","Isprs International Journal of Geo-Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in sensor technology have facilitated deploying SHM systems for large-scale structures and local NDT of structural members. Although both methods have been successfully applied to identify structural damage in various systems, Environmental and Operational Condition (EOC) variations can influence sensor measurements and mask damage signatures in the structural response. EOCs include environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as operational conditions, such as mass loading, vibration, and boundary conditions. The effect of EOCs can significantly undermine the reliability and robustness of damage assessment technologies and limit their performance. Thus, successful SHM and NDT systems can compensate for changing EOCs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the effects of EOCs on SHM and NDT systems. It presents recent developments in advanced sensing technology, signal processing, and analysis techniques that aim to eliminate the masking effect of EOC variations and increase the damage sensitivity and performance of SHM and NDT systems.

Ontologies and metamodels share several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management, where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field.

Hence, the discussion spreads onto analyzing how the concept is approached from different professional fields—for its inherent interdisciplinarity, despite the perceived scarcity of related literature available—but also onto the ambivalence stemming from the nature of the ‘people’ component itself, its functions, and the relationships—formal or informal—that should be established. Finally, the authors go on to critically place the concept within the current urban and real estate trends in both, the Global North and South, while identifying further gaps in the current literature, for example: given today’s critical housing supply and affordability situations, how to get the public and private sectors interested in partnering with people in a more direct way?

Especially in the global context and exacerbated by Covid-19, the applications of the digital twin have offered opportunities for many industries. While the digital twin has already been widely used in many sectors such as manufacturing and the construction industry—one of the key engines of economic development, is still lagging behind many other sectors. This study uses the systematic literature review to assess the applications of digital twin in manufacturing and construction respectively, the benefits it brings, and the impediments to its application. Based on this, a comparison is made of digital twin applications in the manufacturing and construction industries to draw lessons. This study concluded that although the use of digital twin in manufacturing is better than construction overall, it is still not reaching its full potential. Despite many benefits brought by the digital twin to construction during the project lifecycle, the construction sector faces even greater challenges than manufacturing in digital twin adoption. By comparison, this study drew five lessons to drive better adoption of the digital twin. The construction industry needs to accelerate the deployment of relevant hardware, promote the standard unification of digital twin, explore the whole lifecycle application of the digital twin, enhance data protection, and embrace changes. This study was limited in the scope of data collection.

Of the available digital FM systems, Building Information Modelling (BIM) for FM, herein referred to as BIM-FM, is the least developed. Where BIM-FM varies from existing digital FM tools is its advanced 3D visualisation capabilities. A semi-structured literature review is undertaken to assess the current implementation of BIM-FM and identify opportunities to engender its increased adoption. This paper is part of an ongoing piece of research aimed at defining a standard methodology for the application of BIM to historically significant structures, otherwise known as Historic BIM (HBIM). Two existing approaches to BIM-FM, current and developing, are outlined. The potential value BIM-FM can provide according to the literature is discussed but there exists minimal practical evidence to justify these claims. Barriers to its adoption are discussed, with a key underlying barrier found to be a lack of defined user requirements. Consequently, functional, modelling and information requirements established within the literature are identified, and existing attempts at realising the requirements are discussed. Six information categories and two functional requirements are identified. It is theorised that the tendency to utilise simplified geometric models for FM is primarily due to software and practical limitations as opposed to actual end user needs, and it is suggested that this should be investigated further in future work. Attempts at realising BIM-FM user requirements using other advanced technologies, primarily Digital Twins, are investigated and found to be an area of increasing commonality. A new conception of BIM-FM is proposed.","2024","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-06 20:05:20","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using social media to objectively and subjectively analyze large groups of individuals makes it the most effective tool for this task. There are numerous sources of big data within the organization. Social media can be identified by the interaction and communication it facilitates. Utilizing social media has become a daily occurrence in modern society. In addition, this frequent use generates data demonstrating the importance of researching the relationship between big data and social media. It is because so many internet users are also active on social media. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify 42 articles published between 2018 and 2022 that examined the significance of big data in social media and upcoming issues in this field. We also discuss the potential benefits of utilizing big data in social media. Our analysis discovered open problems and future challenges, such as high‐quality data, information accessibility, speed, natural language processing (NLP), and enhancing prediction approaches. As proven by our investigations of evaluation metrics for big data in social media, the distribution reveals that 24% is related to data‐trace, 12% is related to execution time, 21% to accuracy, 6% to cost, 10% to recall, 11% to precision, 11% to F1‐score, and 5% run time complexity.","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-05 01:33:23","","","","","","","Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications. This review covers damage detection, localization, classification, extension, and prognosis, as well as the development of smart structures.

A Review","Agronomy for Sustainable Development","","1774-0746","10.1007/s13593-022-00805-4","","AbstractIntensive agriculture in Germany is not only highly productive but has also led to detrimental effects in the environment. Crop diversification together with new field arrangements considering soil heterogeneities can be an alternative to improve resource use efficiency (RUE), ecosystem services (ESS), and biodiversity. Agroecosystem models are tools that help us to understand and design diversified new field arrangements. The main goal of this study was to review the extent to which agroecosystem models have been used for crop diversification design at field and landscape scale by considering soil heterogeneities and to understand the model requirements for this purpose. We found several agroecosystem models available for simulating spatiotemporal crop diversification at the field scale. For spatial crop diversification, simplified modelling approaches consider crop interactions for light, water, and nutrients, but they offer restricted crop combinations. For temporal crop diversification, agroecosystem models include the major crops (e.g., cereals, legumes, and tuber crops). However, crop parameterization is limited for marginal crops and soil carbon and nitrogen (N). At the landscape scale, decision-making frameworks are commonly used to design diversified cropping systems. Within-field soil heterogeneities are rarely considered in field or landscape design studies. Combining static frameworks with dynamic agroecosystems models can be useful for the design and evaluation of trade-offs for ESS delivery and biodiversity. To enhance modeling capabilities to simulate diversified cropping systems in new field arrangements, it will be necessary to improve the representation of crop interactions, the inclusion of more crop species options, soil legacy effects, and biodiversity estimations. Newly diversified field arrangement design also requires higher data resolution, which can be generated via remote sensing and field sensors. We propose the implementation of a framework that combines static approaches and process-based models for new optimized field arrangement design and propose respective experiments for testing the combined framework.","2022","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-06 19:42:51","","","","","","","Agronomy for Sustainable Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several research works go in this direction, presenting open data impact in the smart city for some, while others have focused on data processing methods. We have therefore deemed it necessary to make a state of the art on these different issues. The particularity of our study is that it shows the link between open data and smart city in all its aspects, describing what kind of open data is suitable for the smart city, how it is important for its development, and how these open data are processed to create services. Thus, in this article, we first present a review of existing surveys since 2015. Then, we present different smart city dimensions based on open data as well as some applications, and we detail how to process these data. We end with a list of open data sources as well as some challenges and solutions related to smart city services. INDEX TERMSData mining, machine learning (ML), open data, smart city. I. INTRODUCTIONA city is not only limited to physical urban spaces (e.g., places, and buildings) but also extends to systems, structures, networks, flows, and processes [1]. This is why Ahlers [2] defines a smart city as a livable, participative, and sustainable city. To develop such a city, open data produced by the different actors of the urban ecosystem play a crucial role [3], since their integration and valorization enable the development of high socio-economic impact services. The data are produced in a digital urban space that is composed of physical spaces (infrastructures, buildings, etc.), social spaces (government, population, organization, culture, etc.), and cyber spaces (internet data, communication data, etc.)  [4]. The data are accessible through three main ways: official data portals (via the internet), big data initiatives (obtained explicitly or implicitly via crawling techniques), and the broader open data community [5]. However, not all open data are smart city-oriented. Prieto et al. [6] established 14 open data categories in the smart city to avoid ambiguity.The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Sathish Kumar .","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-05 19:32:55","","","","","","","Ieee Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a demand to further develop spatio-temporal conceptual models to comprehensively represent the nature of the evolution of geographic objects. The latter involves a set of considerations like those related to managing changes and object identities, modeling possible causal relations, and integrating multiple interpretations. While conventional literature generally presents these concepts separately and rarely approaches them from a holistic perspective, they are in fact interrelated. Therefore, we believe that the semantics of modeling would be improved by considering these concepts jointly. In this work, we propose to represent these interrelationships in the form of a hierarchical pyramidal framework and to further explore this set of concepts. The objective of this framework is to provide a guideline to orient the design of future generations of GIS data models, enabling them to achieve a better representation of available spatio-temporal data. In addition, this framework aims at providing keys for a new interpretation and classification of spatio-temporal conceptual models. This work can be beneficial for researchers, students, and developers interested in advanced spatio-temporal modeling.","2021","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-05 19:36:49","","","","","","","Isprs International Journal of Geo-Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of remote sensing (RS) allows intervention in a specific and differentiated way in olive groves, depending on their variability, in managing different agronomic aspects. The potentialities of the application of RS in olive growing are topics of great agronomic interest to olive growers. Using the tools provided by RS and the modernization of the olive sector can bring great future prospects by reducing costs, optimizing agronomic management, and improving production quantity and quality. This article is part of a review that aims to cover the past, from the 2000s onwards, and the most recent applications of aerial RS in olive growing in order to be able to include research and all topics related to the use of RS on olive trees. As far as the use of RS platforms such as satellites, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as olive growing is concerned, a literature review showed the presence of several works devoted to this topic. This article covers purely agronomic matters of interest to olive farms (and related research that includes the application of RS), such as yielding and managing diseases and pests, and detection and counting of olive trees.

Sepasgozar","Big Data and Its Applications in Smart Real Estate and the Disaster Management Life Cycle: A Systematic Analysis","Big Data and Cognitive Computing","","2504-2289","10.3390/bdcc4020004","","Big data is the concept of enormous amounts of data being generated daily in different fields due to the increased use of technology and internet sources. Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors’ names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.","2020","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-06 20:06:02","","","","","","","Big Data and Cognitive Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A product lifecycle management (PLM) methodology framework is proposed that uses bionics as a technical discipline. The manuscript presents a novel, reverse biomimetics as a shape abstraction methodology to investigate, analyse, and de-feature biological structures through functional morphology as the enabling methodology for studying the relationships between form and function. The novel reverse engineering (RE) format with eleven stages supports technical biology, addressing the abstraction issues which have been identified as the most difficult steps in Fayemi’s eight-step framework. Inverse biomimetics and RE changes functional modelling (FM) from highly abstracted principles to low- or even reality-level abstraction, achieving nature design intents. The goal of the reverse biomimetic approach is to implement functional feature extraction, surface reconstruction, and solid modelling into five stages of a design process. The benefit of virtually mapping this in a pictorial fashion with high-end software fosters a simpler understanding and representation of knowledge transfer from biology to engineering, and can lead to innovative bio-inspired developments. The study aims to present the bionics PLM framework and its comprehensive processes of bionic design and biomimetic modelling, simulation, optimisation, and clinical validation techniques for two large-scale, human skeletal biological systems: a drug-releasing chewing robot and an anthropometric prosthetic hand suitable for introduction to engineering courses. Integration into undergraduate courses would be one route to bolster interest and encourage growth within the subject area in future.","2025","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-06 19:49:16","","","","","","","Biomimetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, it attempts to shed light on media trends and prospects as educational activities and techniques, as well as on the utmost importance of the use of television content as audiovisual educational content. This venture focuses on the cases of Cyprus and Greece following literature materials and reviews, research results, and findings of previous numerous studies and research papers from and through the Internet that were considered as background. The aforementioned were applied in a pilot case study with adult educators as adult learners (18 years and older), providing literature data and historical elements as a source of further study. The findings from the pilot case study revealed that the television content can also shape (adult) learners’ perceptions on how they understand and learn in an online environment in regard to the generational cohort they belong. Furthermore, the results disclosed that an online educational process utilizing audiovisual media technologies and audiovisual content (audiovisual media communications) may support technology-enhanced learning through non-verbal communication in the new streamlined digital era in which we live. An important conclusion of this article is that the (inter)national genealogical characteristics and habits, the inherent and special characteristics, and the socio-cultural identity of learners, as well as the various (inter)national social-phenomena (e.g., media socio-phenomenon, Internet phenomenon, revival phenomenon, etc.) of the past and present, should always be taken into account by education administrators and educators, in order to maintain a quality and sustainable future education.","2021","2025-07-05 00:16:05","2025-07-06 19:44:03","","","","","","","Education Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it could be argued that climate change should now be a primary lens through which cultural heritage conservation and management are viewed. We argue that addressing the growing and compounding risks and impacts of climate change requires a fundamental rethink and transformation of cultural heritage management and policy. In this article, we propose a climate‐smart cultural heritage (CSCH) approach that captures the notion that climate adaptation can be developed and implemented within the heritage sector to simultaneously reduce the impacts of changing climate and variability on tangible and intangible cultural heritage and provide co‐benefits for climate change mitigation while also enhancing human security at different spatial scales. The CSCH is an integrated approach to implementing forward‐looking and transformative cultural heritage management and policy and is not a new set of practices to be advocated to cultural heritage stakeholders and decision‐makers. Findings also demonstrate that institutional mechanisms such as multi‐stakeholder planning, increased awareness of the economic, social, and environmental benefits of diverse cultural heritage, improved cross‐sectoral coordination and communication, strong political will for transformative approaches, and investments in CSCH are necessary for implementation of CSCH.This article is categorized under: Climate, History, Society, Culture &gt; Disciplinary Perspectives The Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge &gt; Climate Science and Decision Making Integrated Assessment of Climate Change &gt; Assessing Climate Change in the Context of Other Issues","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:54","2025-07-17 18:31:48","","","","6","14","","Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews Climate Change","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","WOS:001034567100001","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\35P6ICSG\Sandra Fatorić e Cathy Daly - 2023 - Towards a Climate‐smart Cultural Heritage Management.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can deliver valuable data for the inventory of inaccessible and dangerous areas or objects. The acquisition of data for 3D object modeling is a complicated, time-consuming, and cost-intensive process. It requires the use of expensive equipment and often manual work as well as professional software. These are major barriers limiting the development of modern tourist platforms that promote local attractions. Information technologies offer new opportunities for the development of the services market, including the development of smart tourism services, as an integral part of the smart city concept. 3D models are an important element of this process as they form the basis for the use of new visualization technologies, such as Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality (VR/MR/AR). 3D modeling provides a new opportunity to use AR/MR technology to present information about objects, virtual tours of the historic buildings, and their promotion. It also creates an opportunity to preserve the architectural heritage and preventive maintenance of buildings. Despite the increasing use of new measuring platforms and computer modeling techniques, the implementation of 3D building models in smart tourism services is still limited, focusing more on the results of scientific projects rather than on the implementation of the new ones. The paper presents an universal methodology for the inventory of historical buildings using low-cost UAVs. It describes the most important aspects related to the process of planning UAV measurement missions and photogrammetric data acquisition. The construction of 3D models and the possibilities of their further use to build smart tourism services based on Web/AR/MR/VR technology was also presented.","2020","2025-07-05 00:16:54","2025-07-05 19:21:08","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IRRELEVANTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These behavioural problems have been solved through subjective or objective techniques. Within objective techniques, behavioural modelling in smart environments (SEs) can allow the adequate provision of services to users of SEs with inputs from user modelling. The effectiveness of current behavioural models relative to user-specific preferences is unclear. This study introduces a new approach to behavioural modelling in smart environments by illustrating how human behaviours can be effectively modelled from user models in SEs. To achieve this aim, a new behavioural model, the Positive Behaviour Change (PBC) Model, was developed and evaluated based on the guidelines from the Design Science Research Methodology. The PBC Model emphasises the importance of using user-specific information within the user model for behavioural modelling. The PBC model comprised the SE, the user model, the behaviour model, classification, and intervention components. The model was evaluated using a naturalistic-summative evaluation through experimentation using office workers. The study contributed to the knowledge base of behavioural modelling by providing a new dimension to behavioural modelling by incorporating the user model. The results from the experiment revealed that behavioural patterns could be extracted from user models, behaviours can be classified and quantified, and changes can be detected in behaviours, which will aid the proper identification of the intervention to provide for users with or without behavioural problems in smart environments.","2022","2025-07-05 00:15:40","2025-07-05 19:22:36","","","","","","","Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have shown that place identity is at the core of value-based frameworks of built heritage. This study aims to unveil the role of identity in existing Smart Heritage frameworks, which is currently a gap in existing research. Design/methodology/approach To better understand place identity in the Smart Heritage context and facilitate future framework establishments, this study uses a cross-case analysis method to scrutinise common trends in the identity development of seven current best practices. Findings The results show that current best practices involve smart technologies in sustaining or rebuilding heritage identities, mostly mapped on the local scale. Catered solutions are essential in this context due to historic cities’ variegated pursuits of identity. Most current Smart Heritage projects are at the transitioning stage from digital to smart, as the autonomous ability of smart innovations is yet to be fully realised on the city or the global scale. Researchers are encouraged to draw essence from existing heritage frameworks considering the built heritage’s place identity, which is at the core of culturally sustainable Smart Heritage transitions. Originality/value This study concludes with five recommendations for addressing heritage identity in Smart Heritage frameworks, targeting future research avenues. Also, this study furthers the discussion on the linkage of Smart Heritage, place identity and marketing strategy, contributing to the city branding and tourism management field. Future research should extend the case-study selection beyond Europe, which is a recognised limitation of this study.","2023","2025-07-05 00:14:49","2025-07-07 22:32:50","","","","","","","International Journal of Tourism Cities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INCLUIR; NO_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, it aims to facilitate the contribution of solutions within the field of education and cultural policy for the cultural heritage within this Autonomous Community. The research adheres to quantitative-descriptive methodological principles and, in particular, follows instrumental psychometric studies of reliability and content validity. The results of the instrument were optimal, both in terms of internal reliability and complete global and intra-group content validity, for its application to professional areas of heritage conservation and education and digital cultural management.","2023","2025-07-05 00:16:55","2025-07-17 18:29:06","","","","","","","Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\jaber\Zotero\storage\XBH5ILIL\Delfín Ortega Sánchez e Amparo Bernal López-Sanvicente - 2023 - Design, Content Validity, and Inter-Observer Reliability of the ‘Digitization of Cultural Heritage,.pdf","","INCLUIR; COM_PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research project’s objective, based on defining a “Computational Model of Intersections Simulation/Representation” as complex digital cultural infrastructure and computational knowledge, acquires the identity characteristics of the Computational Representation (phenomenological, geometry, visual, resilience, scalability analytical-interpretative knowledge) to promote for landscape and Cultural Heritage (CH): a) of systematize environmental information and protective by intersections of resilience’s categories in the “thematic systems of families and types” of the landscape; b) a model of Smart CH for Industry 4.0 – 2021. The same time favors: a) thematic and retrospective intersections between formal and interpretative layers for the return of information from a spatial and functional; b) innovation by introduction of professional figures of the contemporary digital. The methodology is articulated on following intersection models: Connotations, Composition, Development (combination of complex formal, structural and geometric factors); Morphogenesis (innovative concepts of transformations form), Sustainability. From the point of view the results and conclusion the study allowed to highlight: a) “network of multi-scalar discrete relationships” with sequences of digital models for the relative tessellation of the surfaces; b) “resilience measure” by “building a digital model of morphogenesis”; c) systematize environmental information and protective by intersections of resilience’s categories in the “thematic systems of families and types” of the landscape; d) “operative and phenomenological reading” of the changing complexity of environmental reality with connections between the behavioural and physical structures of the place.","2021","2025-07-05 00:14:52","2025-07-06 20:03:57","","","","","","","The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEM APLICACAO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
